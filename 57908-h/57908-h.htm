    <div>INTRODUCTION TO THE TWILIGHT ANIMAL STORIES</div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>All little boys and girls who love animals
should become acquainted with Bumper the
white rabbit, with Bobby Gray Squirrel,
with Buster the bear, and with White Tail
the deer, for they are all a jolly lot, brave and
fearless in danger, and so lovable that you
won’t lay down any one of the books without
saying wistfully, “I almost wish I had them
really and truly as friends and not just storybook
acquaintances.” That, of course, is a
splendid wish; but none of us could afford to
have a big menagerie of wild animals, and
that’s just what you would have to do if you
went outside of the books. Bumper had many
friends, such as Mr. Blind Rabbit, Fuzzy Wuzz
and Goggle Eyes, his country cousins; and
Bobby Gray Squirrel had his near cousins,
Stripe the chipmunk and Webb the flying
squirrel; while Buster and White Tail were
favored with an endless number of friends and
relatives. If we turned them all loose from the
books, and put them in a ten-acre lot—but
no, ten acres wouldn’t be big enough to
accommodate them, perhaps not a hundred
acres.</p>

<p class='c011'>So we will leave them just where they are—in
the books—and read about them, and
let our imaginations take us to them where we
can see them playing, skipping, singing, and
sometimes fighting, and if we read very carefully,
and <i>think</i> as we go along, we may come
to know them even better than if we went out
hunting for them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another thing we should remember. By
leaving them in the books, hundreds and
thousands of other boys and girls can enjoy
them, too, sharing with us the pleasures of
the imagination, which after all is one of the
greatest things in the world. In gathering
them together in a real menagerie, we would be
selfish both to Bumper, Bobby, Buster, White
Tail and their friends as well as to thousands
of other little readers who could not share
them with us. So these books of Twilight
Animal Stories are dedicated to all little boys
and girls who love wild animals. All others
are forbidden to read them! They wouldn’t
understand them if they did.</p>

<p class='c011'>So come out into the woods with me, and
let us listen and watch, and I promise you it
will be worth while.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>STORY I<br /> <span class='large'>BUMPER HUNTS WITH THE PACK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Bumper the White Rabbit, when he escaped
from Edith, the red-headed girl who owned the
garden where he lived, found his way into the
woods, and, after many adventures with the Bats,
the Crow, the Fox and Buster the Bear, he was
adopted by the wild rabbits as their leader and
king. The Old Blind Rabbit welcomed him, and
told the story of how it was prophesied that some
day a pure white rabbit, with pink eyes, would
come to deliver them from their enemies, and
teach them how to live in the woods without fear
of danger.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one had been more surprised than Bumper
at this sudden welcome. At first he was for telling
them he was no leader, and not fit to be their
king; but, as he was very lonely and without a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>home, the fear they might drive him out of the
burrow if he protested and explained he was just
an ordinary timid white rabbit that had strayed
from the city decided him to keep quiet and accept
the situation.</p>

<p class='c011'>Playing king was not an agreeable rôle for
Bumper. In the first place, he felt unequal to
it; and, in the second, he felt a good deal like an
impostor. How Jimsy and Wheedles, his two
brothers in the city, would laugh at the idea!
They didn’t think he possessed any kingly qualities.
They would even dispute his leadership in
their own family.</p>

<p class='c011'>But one thing gave Bumper considerable self-confidence.
He was the only white rabbit in the
woods. None of the wild animals, except Buster
the Bear, who had spent a few years in a city Zoo,
had ever seen a white rabbit. They didn’t believe
such a creature lived. And the pink eyes! Why,
they alone were enough to distinguish him from
his country cousins, and set him apart as one
to be admired.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no question about the admiration
all the rabbits felt for him. Respect amounting
almost to awe for his wonderful fur of white,
and his eyes of a delicate shade of pink, made
them feel that he was a real king of their tribe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper, after a while, grew accustomed to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>admiration, and he began to feel pardonable
pride in his beautiful fur. Perhaps, after all, there
was something to the story the Old Blind Rabbit
told. If looks made one a king then certainly
Bumper was entitled to the position. He recalled
the words of his mother, when she told him he
was the handsomest of her children, with the
purest white fur and the pinkest of pink eyes.
Was that another indication that he was designed
by nature to rule over his wild people?</p>

<p class='c011'>But on one point Bumper entertained no illusions.
He was conscious of his ignorance of
the woods and the ways of the wild creatures.
Why, he hardly knew one from another! He
had failed to recognize Mr. Crow on their first
meeting, and it is doubtful if he would have
known Mr. Fox immediately if Mr. Bull-Frog
hadn’t pointed him out. Buster the Bear he had
recognized, for he had seen bears in the city Zoo,
and the Bats and Mr. Sewer Rat were old city
friends of his.</p>

<p class='c011'>But the woods were full of other strange animals.
He heard Spotted Tail, a big gray rabbit,
and Fuzzy Wuzz, a demure little maiden of a
rabbit with soft brown eyes, refer repeatedly to
Billy the Mink, Mr. Beaver, Sleepy the Opossum,
Browny the Muskrat, Washer the Raccoon
and Curly the Skunk. Now to Bumper all these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>names meant nothing, for he had never met the
owners of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Were they friends or enemies of the rabbits?
If by chance he should meet one what would he
do? Run away as from a great danger, or greet
him pleasantly? Which were the dangerous animals,
and which were the harmless ones?</p>

<p class='c011'>Unable to answer this question, and dreading
lest he make a mistake that might cause him embarrassment
if he went out hunting with the pack,
he pleaded weariness from his travels, and remained
in the burrow for three whole days.</p>

<p class='c011'>During this time he made it a point to ply
the Old Blind Rabbit with questions, storing up
in his mind for future use any words of wisdom
that dropped from the shrunken lips of the
former leader. His attention flattered the Old
Blind Rabbit, who told Bumper many tales and
stories of his people, and of the troubles they experienced
in the woods.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My gravest fear for my people is,” he said,
“that they will never learn to be fearless and
self-possessed. A very little thing frightens
them and makes them panicky.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper stored this bit of information away in
a corner of his mind. “I must not get panicky
even if the others do,” he said to himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And another weakness of theirs is that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>always do the same thing over and over again,”
continued the Old Blind Rabbit, “and our
enemies know it, and thereby trap them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must never do the same thing twice alike,”
Bumper reflected. “That’s dangerous in the
woods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Many other bits of wisdom fell from the lips
of the Old Blind Rabbit, and Bumper remembered
all of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, he couldn’t stay in the burrow forever.
Sooner or later he had to hunt with the
pack. They went out every day to get their
food, and to enjoy the sunshine. So on the
fourth day of his coming, when Spotted Tail
asked him if he was going to accompany them,
he said yes, and prepared to lead the way.</p>

<p class='c011'>And on that first day he applied some of the
Old Blind Rabbit’s wisdom, which greatly increased
the respect of his cousins for him. They
were feeding on birch leaves and bark in a clearing
a long, long distance from the burrow when
they were startled by the baying of hounds.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The dogs and hunters are coming,” Spotted
Tail exclaimed in fright. “When they appear
we must run to the left.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why to the left?” asked Bumper curiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because rabbits always run that way, making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>a wide circle to throw the hounds off their
track.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But if you do that you’re sure to come back
to the starting point, aren’t you?” asked
Bumper.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail didn’t know. He had never
given it much thought; but now that Bumper
mentioned it he did recall many mishaps where
rabbits pursued by the dogs ran plump into the
arms of hunters who seemed to be waiting for
them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a simple trick,” added Bumper. “They
send the dogs after you, and then stand still until
you make a wide circle and come back to the
starting point. Then they shoot you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t know,” replied Spotted Tail. “But
we’ve always circled around to the left.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” said Bumper quickly, “we’re going to
run straight ahead to-day, and then when we
have left the hounds behind we’ll go back to the
burrow in another way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But all of our people have circled to the
left—” began Spotted Tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come, follow me, straight ahead,” interrupted
Bumper.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was surprise and consternation at this
order. Old habits were strong, and Bumper was
too new yet as a leader to impress all. Some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>followed him, and others without really intending
to do it began circling around to the left.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper and his followers reached home in
safety. They easily shook off the dogs, and returned
to the burrow without sighting the
hunters.</p>

<p class='c011'>But not so with Spotted Tail and the few older
ones who had followed him. They had run
plump into the hunters, and while no one was
seriously wounded by the shots fired at them
several limped and showed blood on their coats.
The Old Blind Rabbit listened to the accounts
of the chase, and then said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the use of having a king and leader
if you don’t obey his orders and follow him? The
next time, Spotted Tail, you will listen to wisdom.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c012'>STORY II<br /> <span class='large'>BUMPER’S IGNORANCE EXCITES SUSPICION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Spotted Tail was not pleased by the rebuff
the Old Blind Rabbit gave him in the presence
of the others. In particular he resented it because
Fuzzy Wuzz, who had followed Bumper’s
lead, sided against him, and seemed to think he
was in the wrong.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail had aspired to leadership of the
family after Old Blind Rabbit’s death. In fact,
he had been acting in that capacity for some time
before Bumper appeared, but always taking his
orders from their old blind leader. The sudden
elevation of the white rabbit to the position he
coveted had not improved his temper.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were several others who sympathized
with Spotted Tail, and the division in the sentiment
of the burrow made Bumper feel uncomfortable.
He was no exception to the rule that
“uneasy rests the head that wears a crown”, although
in his case it was a crown in name only,
that he wore.</p>

<p class='c011'>But his first triumph in leading the pack gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>him new courage, and perhaps a little bumptiousness.
“All I’ve got to do,” he reflected, “is to
use my wits. That’s what saved me from Mr.
Crow and Mr. Fox.”</p>

<p class='c011'>So Bumper began to study the ways of his
country people more carefully. He made friends
with Fuzzy Wuzz, and she taught him many
things. For one, that it was much easier to lead
the young people into new ways than the old
ones.</p>

<p class='c011'>But on the other hand Bumper found that the
young rabbits were inclined to be careless and
reckless, which often got them in trouble. Indeed,
Fuzzy Wuzz herself was apt to make mistakes
by doing things an older and more experienced
rabbit would not.</p>

<p class='c011'>But it was Bumper who made the greatest mistake
of all the young ones, and through his ignorance
nearly lost all the glory he had gained
in leading his followers away from the hunters.
It happened on the third trip from the burrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Goggle Eyes, a fat, lazy rabbit, who was forever
stuffing himself, and thinking of his stomach,
reported a wonderful feeding ground in a clearing
where a woodsman had put up a cabin and
planted fields of turnips, cabbages, lettuce and
other luscious vegetables.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He’s away all day,” said Goggle Eyes, “and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>we don’t have to wait until dark to raid his patch.
I crossed it to-day, and ate some of the most
delicious turnips I ever tasted. I’ll lead you
to it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was good news to the rabbits, for it was
a long time since any of them had tasted turnips
or cabbages. They don’t grow in the wild woods,
and even Bumper hadn’t had a smell of one since
he left the red-headed girl’s garden.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were all eager to visit the field, and bright
and early, under Goggle Eyes’s leadership, they
sallied forth. The way was through the heart of
the big woods, and then along a beautiful stream
of water until they came to the clearing.</p>

<p class='c011'>The field of vegetables was some distance from
the cabin, and after Goggle Eyes announced that
the coast was clear, they hopped through the rail
fence, and began greedily filling their little
stomachs. What a feast it was! Nothing had
ever tasted better to Bumper and he munched the
succulent leaves of the cabbages and lettuce and
the thick, fleshy turnips until it seemed as if he
couldn’t eat another mouthful.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then out of sheer happiness he rolled around
in the field. The younger rabbits, taking this
as a signal for play, began rolling and frolicking
around, too, chasing each other’s tails in and out
among the vegetables. Bumper forgot all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>dignity of a king and played the hardest of any.</p>

<p class='c011'>Goggle Eyes picked off a big cabbage leaf and
tried to hide from the others under it. Spotted
Tail jerked up a small turnip by the roots, and
threw it over his head at him. Fuzzy Wuzz
kicked up her hind legs and sent a shower of dirt
all over Goggle Eyes hiding under the leaf.</p>

<p class='c011'>Not to be outdone by the others, Bumper
looked around for something to throw. Near
him, hanging from a low branch of a bush, was a
big gray ball that wasn’t either a vegetable or a
stone. He bumped against it with his nose, and
found it so light that he could lift it with his
front paws easily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look out!” he shouted gleefully. “I’m going
to throw this ball at you, Goggle Eyes!”</p>

<p class='c011'>All the players turned, and when they saw
what it was they looked a little horrified, and then
taking Bumper’s threat as a joke they laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I dare you to do it!” exclaimed Spotted Tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>This dare was accepted at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Stand back, all of you, then!” Bumper
added. “I want to aim straight. No,” he continued,
changing his mind, “I won’t throw it at
Goggle Eyes. I’ll toss it up in the air, and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘What goes up must come down,</div>
      <div class='line'>Either on heads or on the ground.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>“You can’t do it, Bumper!” exclaimed one of
the older rabbits.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can’t do it!” retorted Bumper, puffing up
his cheeks at what he considered a challenge to
his strength. The ball was twice the size of his
head, and at a distance looked big and heavy.
But Bumper had tested its weight, and found it
light and easy to handle. Here was a good
chance to make them think he was strong and
muscular.</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed good-naturedly, and added: “I’ll
show you if I can’t! I’ve thrown bigger balls
than this one.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He turned to grab it in his two front paws,
but Fuzzy Wuzz turned suddenly pale, and cried:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Bumper, don’t—please don’t!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Proud of the attention he was attracting, and
pleased at the thought that Fuzzy Wuzz didn’t
want to see him strain himself, he smiled, and
put all the strength he had in the pull that loosened
the big ball from the twig. After that it
was easy to lift it in his two paws. It was almost
as light as a toy balloon.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the rabbits set up an exclamation of surprise
and horror. “Oh! Oh! Run!” they
shouted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, Bumper thought this was from fear
that the ball might be thrown at them, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>smiled. But when they all scampered away to
a great distance, and a queer humming sound
came out of the ball he held in his paws, he began
to wonder if he had made a mistake through
ignorance.</p>

<p class='c011'>It did not take him long to find out. The humming
and buzzing inside the ball increased, and
then out of one end appeared Mr. Yellow Jacket
and his wife and all their children. The ball was
a hornet’s nest, and the irate family were pouring
out of their home pell-mell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper felt a sharp sting on the end of his
ear, a sting like the pricking of a thousand
needles, and another on the tip of his nose. With
that he gave a squeal of pain, and threw the
ball far from him. The next he scampered away
after the others, pursued by a dozen angry Yellow
Jackets.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was not until they were at a safe distance
that they stopped. Then Spotted Tail turned to
Bumper, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What an idiot you were! Or didn’t you know
it was Mr. Yellow Jacket’s home?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper was on the point of confessing his
ignorance when he thought of the consequence.
A king should know everything, and to admit
he didn’t know a hornet’s nest from a ball would
be a terrible blow to his pride. So he suppressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the groan that the pain on his ear and nose
caused, and said indignantly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Know it was Mr. Yellow Jacket’s home!
Why, what an idea! But somebody had to pull
it down, or Fuzzy Wuzz and the children might
get stung. It was better that I should suffer
than they, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Which speech they all applauded, and said
that Bumper was as brave as he was wise.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c012'>STORY III<br /> <span class='large'>BUMPER SAVES FUZZY WUZZ FROM SNAKE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>While accepting smilingly the plaudits of the
others for what seemed to be great bravery on
his part in tearing down the hornet’s nest in the
vegetable patch, Bumper was greatly disturbed
by his display of ignorance. Had it dawned
upon him that the big round ball was the home
of Mr. and Mrs. Yellow Jacket, he would have
scampered away with the rest.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a narrow escape from disgrace.
Spotted Tail had been suspicious, but Bumper’s
ready wit in turning aside the awkward question
had won him further glory. But right down in
his heart he wasn’t sure that Spotted Tail had
been convinced. He eyed Bumper curiously.
Bumper was certain that he was watching him
with suspicious eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must be more careful,” he reasoned.
“Spotted Tail has no love for me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But if Spotted Tail was disloyal, Fuzzy Wuzz
was the soul of honor and loyalty. She looked at
Bumper through her meek, brown eyes in a way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>that made him happy. Fuzzy Wuzz was a particularly
handsome rabbit, and there was royal
blood in her veins. She could trace her ancestry
way back to the first leader of her race, the white
rabbit who had predicted the coming of Bumper.
That was so many years ago that none but the
Old Blind Rabbit had any memory of it. But
the blood of this royal leader still showed itself
in many of his descendants.</p>

<p class='c011'>For instance, Fuzzy Wuzz had more white
than brown or gray on her back and head. Her
breast was pure white, and most of her head,
while there were patches of it on her sides. But
the mixture of blood had given her some very
dark coloring, which made her anything but a
white rabbit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fuzzy Wuzz was bright and cheerful, always
smiling or laughing, and her wit sometimes
equalled that of Bumper. It was not unnatural,
therefore, that Bumper should select her for special
marks of friendship. A close intimacy
sprang up between them, and they often hopped
off in the woods together to feed by themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper found that Fuzzy Wuzz knew a lot
more about wood lore than he, and pursuing his
plan to gain all the information he could from
every one he made good use of her friendship.
Pretending to test her knowledge, he would ask
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>her all sorts of questions, which she answered
readily like a school boy being quizzed by his
teacher.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why do you ask me such silly questions?”
she asked one day. “You’d think I didn’t know
anything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, that isn’t it,” replied Bumper, assuming
a friendly attitude. “I don’t want you to get
in trouble in the woods and when Old Blind Rabbit
trusts you with me I must be sure you know
how to look after yourself if I should leave you
for an instant. What would you do, for instance,
if Mr. Fox should appear and chase you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I’d run if I could. Maybe I’d be so
frightened I’d fall down in a faint.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s what you shouldn’t do,” cautioned
Bumper. “If you get panicky you’d lose your
head, and run right into his jaws.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What would you do if he chased you?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll tell you what I did do when Mr. Fox
nearly caught me,” he replied. Then he related
to her the story of how he had induced the fox
to look at the sun until he was temporarily
blinded. Fuzzy Wuzz laughed at this until the
tears ran down her cheeks. Then she added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It was very bright of you. I’m sure I’d
never think of such a trick.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“I’m not so sure of that,” replied Bumper.
“You’re bright enough, but if you lost your wits
you might forget what to do.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was shortly after this conversation that
Fuzzy Wuzz got in trouble, and Bumper came
to her rescue and saved her by his wits. They
had been feeding on the luscious stalks of wild
celery near the marsh when they gradually got
separated. Fuzzy Wuzz was nibbling away at
the leaves all unconscious of danger when she
was startled by a loud hiss in front of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked up in surprise, and saw facing her
not a foot away a tremendous blacksnake. He
was the king blacksnake of the woods, with a
body almost as big around as her head, and a
tail that stretched way off in the distance. The
rabbits called him Killer the Snake because he
had destroyed so many birds and young bunnies.
He was so big and ferocious that he could swallow
a small rabbit whole.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Fuzzy Wuzz saw Killer the Snake so
close to her she became paralyzed with fear. Instead
of using her wits as Bumper had cautioned
when in danger she simply crouched down, and
made a pitiful little noise of terror. Killer, conscious
of his magnetic power, swayed his head
back and forth, his small, beady eyes on her,
and began approaching in slow, rhythmic motions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Fuzzy Wuzz for the life of her couldn’t move,
but she kept up her pitiful little moaning.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was this noise that attracted Bumper, and
he called out: “What’s the matter, Fuzzy
Wuzz?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no answer but the moaning continued.
Bumper stopped chewing the delicious
leaf he had in his mouth, and hopped in her direction.
His coming must have disturbed Killer,
for he shook his head angrily, and half turned
to face this unknown thing hopping through the
bushes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper came upon Killer from behind. He
had never seen a snake before, but the long black
body half coiled like a rope instantly told him
that it meant danger. A sight of Fuzzy Wuzz
confirmed his suspicions. Bumper’s first intention
was to pounce upon the snake to save Fuzzy
Wuzz. Then he stopped to think. No, this
would never do. Killer might then turn and
make short work of him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper kept at a respectable distance while
he tried to work his wits, although this was difficult
with Fuzzy Wuzz’s pitiful moaning in his
ears. Then suddenly he saw his opportunity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some distance back from Killer was a big
tree that had been snapped off near the ground
by a terrific wind. It was still held suspended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>in air by a few branches and the bark that had
not been broken by the storm.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper turned and hopped toward this tree.
Killer watched him suspiciously, but as he remained
at a safe distance he turned his head
slowly back to Fuzzy Wuzz. Bumper began
gnawing at the bark which held the tree suspended
over the spot where Killer lay. He
gnawed with his sharp teeth until they began to
bleed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Fuzzy Wuzz, thinking that he had deserted
her, moaned louder than ever, and Killer, sure
now that Bumper wasn’t going to attack him
from the rear, turned all his attention to his victim.
It was a moment of terrible suspense to
Bumper. Would Killer reach Fuzzy Wuzz before
he could cut the bark so the tree would fall?
How tough the bark seemed! He gnawed and
chewed with all his might, ripping big pieces off
it. But still the tree hung suspended in the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then suddenly, after one desperate effort,
Bumper was rewarded by seeing the giant trunk
drop down an inch then two inches, then—</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a crash like a thunder-clap, and
sticks and branches flew in the air. Bumper
jumped to one side as the big trunk fell to the
ground, catching Killer by the tail. The tree
fell right across the lower part of the snake’s
body, and pinioned him there.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Now run, Fuzzy Wuzz!” shouted Bumper.
“There’s no danger!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Fuzzy Wuzz gave one quick glance at the
squirming, twisting snake, and then darted off
toward home, with Bumper close behind her.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>
  <h2 class='c012'>STORY IV<br /> <span class='large'>SPOTTED TAIL SHOWS ENMITY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>You can imagine how grateful Fuzzy Wuzz
was to Bumper for saving her from Killer the
Snake! Not only that, but she was mightily impressed
by his wisdom. Who but a king would
have thought of gnawing off the butt of the tree
so it would fall on Killer!</p>

<p class='c011'>She was so grateful that she told the story
again and again to her people, and they seemed
as greatly impressed as Fuzzy Wuzz at
Bumper’s shrewdness. But Spotted Tail was not
pleased. Perhaps he was still suspicious, and
thought it was more luck than knowledge that
had saved Bumper’s reputation. He still believed
that Bumper had never seen a hornet’s
nest until that day he innocently mistook Mr.
Yellow Jacket’s home for a big, harmless ball.</p>

<p class='c011'>This fact, coupled with several other little
things that he had observed, Bumper’s avoidance
of certain plants, for instance, that he seemed to
think might be poisonous until the others ate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>them, convinced him that Bumper was not fit to
be the leader of his people.</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Old Blind Rabbit could see with his eyes,”
he reasoned, “he’d know, too. But some day
I’ll catch him, and show him up. He’s no king,
for a king should know everything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>By letting such things dwell upon his mind,
Spotted Tail worked himself up into a pitch of
excitement that was not pleasant. He fancied
himself wronged by Bumper. If the white rabbit
hadn’t come into the woods, Spotted Tail
would have been chosen the natural leader.</p>

<p class='c011'>Jealousy and spite are enough to sour any
disposition, and Spotted Tail was in a fair way
of showing that he was not really fitted to be
a leader. A good leader never grows sullen and
discontented because somebody else happens to
get more favors than he. Fuzzy Wuzz’s attachment
to Bumper further increased Spotted Tail’s
displeasure. In time he came almost to hating
Bumper, and tried to think of ways and means
to disgrace him before the others.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper was only partly conscious of this feeling
toward him. He knew that Spotted Tail was
suspicious of his knowledge of wood lore, and
he was on his guard all the time to prevent any
mistake that would give him away. But he never
dreamed that the big rabbit was beginning to dislike
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>him. He seldom hunted with him, and had
few words with him, but there had been no open
enmity between them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then one day in the woods Bumper found himself
unexpectedly separated from the others, with
only Spotted Tail in view. Fuzzy Wuzz and the
rest had crossed the brook on a natural rustic
bridge of logs, and were feeding on the opposite
side when Bumper discovered them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello!” he exclaimed. “How’d they get
across there? Surely, they didn’t jump that distance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail, to whom this was addressed, replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You should know by this time that a rabbit
never jumps a stream that he can get across any
other way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper nodded and smiled. “Still, I don’t
see how else they got across.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail said indifferently:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I suppose they crossed on Mr. Beaver’s
house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This remark caused Bumper to reflect. He
had heard of Mr. Beaver, but he wasn’t sure just
what kind of an animal he was. And his house
was more of a mystery to him than anything else.</p>

<p class='c011'>“On Mr. Beaver’s house?” he asked, before
thinking. “Oh, you mean—”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>He stopped in confusion, and Spotted Tail
smiled gleefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You mean what?” he asked, his eyes twinkling
wickedly. “Don’t you know what kind of
a house Mr. Beaver builds?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, what a question?” laughed Bumper,
trying to evade a direct answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think it’s a very natural question,” added
Spotted Tail. “I don’t believe you ever saw
Mr. Beaver or his house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper laughed heartily at this, but it was a
laugh to conceal his embarrassment and not an
expression of his enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ho! Ho! You can be very comical if you
want to!” he said. “Now maybe <i>you</i> can describe
what sort of a house Mr. Beaver builds.
Let me see if you can.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Spotted Tail felt he had Bumper in a
corner, and he wasn’t to be bluffed. “I could
describe it,” he said, leering, “but I don’t have
to. If you have any eyes in your head you can
see for yourself what it is like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How’s that?” asked Bumper, growing more
uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just what I said,” was the quick rejoinder.
“We’ve been standing near it for some time, and
you can see it with your own eyes—if you know
where to look for it.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“Oh! Ho!” laughed Bumper, less joyously
than before. “Mr. Beaver’s house is in plain
sight, is it? Well, then, neither one of us will
have to describe it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, but where is it?” pursued Spotted Tail
relentlessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now Bumper was in a terrible quandary.
There was nothing in view that looked like a
house. So he cast a glance up at the trees, hoping
to find it among the branches, and then back
through the thick, tangled bushes. There was
nothing in sight that suggested the home of any
animal.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the time his eyes were searching around
for some evidence of Mr. Beaver’s house, Spotted
Tail was watching him with an exultant grin on
his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! I thought so,” he said finally, with a
triumphant grin on his face. “You don’t know
what kind of a house Mr. Beaver builds. You
don’t even know where he builds it. You’ve been
looking for it up among the trees, and back in
the woods. Ho! Ho! And you call yourself a
leader—the king of the rabbits! Why, you don’t
know anything about the woods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper felt he was cornered, and he was
mighty glad the others were not present to witness
his discomfit.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“Now, if you’re king, show me where Mr.
Beaver’s house is, and where he builds it!” continued
Spotted Tail. “If you can’t I’ll go back
and tell all the others you’re an ignorant impostor.
You’re no king! You don’t know anything
about the woods or its people. A king indeed!”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was such scorn and contempt in the
voice that Bumper winced. He realized for the
first time that he had an enemy in Spotted Tail.
There was no other excuse for his words and actions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spotted Tail,” Bumper began in an injured
voice, “why do you dislike me, and try to offend
me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Don’t give me any such talk,” rudely interrupted
the other. “I see through it all. You’re
trying to avoid the question. Answer me!
Where’s Mr. Beaver’s house? If you don’t know,
confess your ignorance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper’s wits failed him for the first time.
He saw no way out of the corner. Spotted Tail
had him, and the disgrace of confession was horribly
mortifying.</p>

<p class='c011'>A sudden splash in the water attracted his attention.
A big rat-like animal was swimming
toward the shore, with only his head and muzzle
above the surface. Bumper watched him in fascination.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>When he reached the shore, he crawled
upon it, and said quite angrily:</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish, Mr. Spotted Tail, your people would
stop crawling across the roof of my house. It
annoys me very much. I was fast asleep when
they thumped over it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail was deeply upset by this interruption,
and Bumper’s wits, coming to his rescue,
made him smile. Speaking at a venture, he addressed
the rat-like animal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll ask them not to do it again, Mr. Beaver.
Of course, it is very annoying to be disturbed
when asleep by people climbing over the roof
of your house.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you!” replied Mr. Beaver, dipping
into the water and swimming back to his dam.
Bumper pointed to the dam across the stream,
and said to Spotted Tail: “There’s Mr. Beaver’s
house.”</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>STORY V<br /> <span class='large'>A TEST OF FLEETNESS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Confident that he had Bumper cornered, and
that nothing but the timely appearance of Mr.
Beaver had saved him from disgraceful confession,
Spotted Tail returned to the burrow in an
angry mood. He had not stopped even to look
when Bumper triumphantly pointed out the
beaver dam. He had hoped to be able to tell the
others how Bumper was ignorant of such a common
thing as a beaver’s dam, and now he had
nothing but an empty triumph. Mr. Beaver had
spoilt everything for him—that and Bumper’s
ready wit.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he was all the more determined to show
him up. He began to brag about his knowledge
of woodcraft, telling many stories of his shrewdness
and skill. Bumper remained quiet, and listened
with the others.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail then switched to another subject.
“But it takes more than knowledge and skill to
be a good leader,” he said. “One must be as
swift as the wind as well as wise as the owl.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stopped suddenly and turned to the white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>rabbit. “A king ought to be the swiftest runner
of his people, Bumper. Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I suppose he should be, if—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then are you the fleetest runner in the
woods?” interrupted Spotted Tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, I’ve never tried it. I’m sure I don’t
know,” Bumper stammered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail, sure of his fleetness of foot, decided
to challenge him to a race. Nothing would
humiliate Bumper more than to be defeated in
a speed trial.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A king should not only be the swiftest and
wisest of his people,” he said slowly, “but there
should be no doubt in his own mind of it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A king doesn’t always tell what’s in his
mind,” replied Bumper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, but he should prove his skill and ability
when challenged,” was the quick retort.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t know that I was challenged,” replied
Bumper, in a weak voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail smiled wickedly. “But you are,
Bumper. I, Spotted Tail, the swiftest and
strongest rabbit in the woods, and the wisest,
challenge you to run a race with me. Are you
afraid?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail’s friends immediately clapped
their paws and nodded their heads. Fuzzy Wuzz
and the other followers of Bumper looked a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>worried, but their faith in their white leader came
to their rescue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, yes,” they said in a breath, “Bumper
will race Spotted Tail, and prove to him that he
is no longer the swiftest and strongest rabbit of
the woods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of course! Of course!” echoed Spotted
Tail’s friends. “There will be a race—a fair
race—and a long race. We will all turn out to
see it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper’s heart began to quake. Spotted Tail
had long, powerful legs and he could use them
to good purpose. He was cut out for a fleet runner,
and Bumper had no illusions on that point.
His life in the city had never given him a chance
to train for long running, and his muscles had
never been fully developed. He had his misgivings
about his speed when compared with that of
this big, powerful wild cousin of his.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, as he recalled the wild flight he had made
when pursued by the bats in the sewer, and of
his subsequent race with Mr. Fox in the woods,
a smile crept into his face. He had certainly run
fast on those two occasions.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fear makes a rabbit run faster than anything
else,” he remembered hearing the Old Blind
Rabbit remark one day.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish then,” Bumper said to himself, “if I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>must race with Spotted Tail I’d get a good fright.
Maybe I would beat him then.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was no way out of the challenge.
Spotted Tail had made it, and all the others, including
friends and foes, had taken it up.
Bumper could not withdraw without disgracing
himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>The test of speed was to be one of endurance
as well as of fleetness of foot. It was arranged
to run a mile straight out to Mr. Beaver’s dam,
and back again. A committee of four were to
wait for them at the dam to see that each contestant
rounded the point. This would prevent
any trick on the part of either one.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper realized right away that it was speed
and endurance that would tell. Wit and wisdom
would have nothing to do with the decision.
Spotted Tail really had the advantage, for he was
more familiar with the trails and by-paths so that
he could seek out the best in going and coming.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nevertheless, Bumper put up a brave front,
and entered the race with the determination to do
his best. They started from the burrow on even
terms, and shot through the bushes at a tremendous
speed. For a time they kept abreast within
sight of each other. Then they became separated,
for Spotted Tail veered off to the right to follow
an easier trail.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Bumper had great difficulty in getting to the
beaver’s dam, for twice he got lost in the bushes,
and had hard work finding the trail again. He
lost so much by this that when he reached the
dam, he was not surprised to hear his friends
shout:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hurry! Hurry, Bumper! Spotted Tail’s
on his way back!”</p>

<p class='c011'>The first half of the race was lost to him; but
he could not refrain from calling back to his
friends: “The race is never decided until it’s finished.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Fuzzy Wuzz and the others clapped their hands
at this confident remark. Instead of losing faith
in him they were more certain than ever that
Bumper would win.</p>

<p class='c011'>Well, it didn’t look so to Bumper. He felt
that he could never overtake Spotted Tail and
beat him to the finish. He might be a quarter
of a mile ahead of him, and running like the
wind. The disheartening effect of being beaten
to the first stake told on his speed, and he ran
only half-heartedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then suddenly out of the bushes on his right
sprang something red and flashing. Bumper
caught sight of it, and his heart gave a great
bound of fear. It was Mr. Fox!</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper’s fright was so great that he sprang
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>over a clump of bushes that he never thought he
could clear. Then, with his heart in his mouth,
he ran for dear life. The Old Blind Rabbit’s
wise remark that “fear makes a rabbit run faster
than anything else” never occurred to him. He
was too frightened to think of anything. But,
oh, how he ran! His feet barely touched the
ground. He seemed to be flying rather than running.
Never—not even when the Bats pursued
him—had he run so fast.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the fox kept close behind him, gaining a
few steps now and then, but losing whenever
Bumper took one of his wild leaps. It was a
terrible race, in which death or life was the stake.
If he weakened or faltered an instant, those red,
dripping jaws would have him.</p>

<p class='c011'>When Bumper came within sight of the burrow
near the big rock, he could see the rabbits
waiting for the end of the race. They were talking
and chatting among themselves. Spotted
Tail was not in sight. Perhaps he had already
finished.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Scatter! Scatter for your life!” called
Bumper, as he took a wild leap in the air.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s Bumper!” some one cried. Then they
caught sight of the red streak in pursuit. “Mr.
Fox is after him! Run for the burrow!”</p>

<p class='c011'>They scampered for shelter just as Bumper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>cleared the starting line and eluded the fox by
a narrow margin. Once inside the burrow, he
asked: “Where’s Spotted Tail?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He hasn’t come yet. You won the race,
Bumper!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And later, when Spotted Tail appeared, he
was in a crestfallen mood, for when the race was
apparently won by him he had been frightened
off the trail by the sudden appearance of Mr.
Fox. Instead of running straight ahead, he had
dodged into the bushes to hide.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When you’re racing,” remarked Bumper,
“you don’t want to turn aside for anything—not
even to save your hide.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>
  <h2 class='c012'>STORY VI<br /> <span class='large'>A TEST OF COURAGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Spotted Tail was so chagrined by losing the
race that he immediately began to scheme to
humiliate Bumper in some other way. He was
confident that the race hadn’t gone to the swiftest
and strongest, but he could not convince the
others of this. The story of how the tortoise beat
the hare in a race, because the latter had lain
down to sleep on the way, was an old joke among
the rabbits, and Spotted Tail’s excuses only
aroused mirth and derision.</p>

<p class='c011'>No, clearly, Spotted Tail could not redeem his
lost glory by challenging Bumper to another
race. But there were other ways to discredit
him in the eyes of his people.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, Bumper, King of the rabbits!” he exclaimed
one day in mock courtesy. “The Lion
is called the King of the beasts, and he won that
title by his bravery and courage. Do you think
that should make one king?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Courage is a quality that every king and
leader should have,” replied Bumper, cautiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Greater than that of any of his subjects?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Bumper hesitated, for he feared a trap; but
when all the others looked at him, waiting upon
his words, he felt that he had to assent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I suppose he should be the bravest of
his people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then,” smiled Spotted Tail, “you must be
the bravest of all the rabbits in the woods—braver
than Old Blind Rabbit ever was, or any of the
young ones here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I shouldn’t like to claim that,” faltered
Bumper, modestly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you shouldn’t be king. Isn’t that the
law of the woods?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A leader should be as brave as any of his
people,” Bumper answered, “not braver. Perhaps
that would be impossible.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well said,” muttered the Old Blind Rabbit.
“There are many of my people who are brave
as any king, and more could not be asked of their
leader.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail licked his lips and smiled. “We
should make a test,” he added, “to see who are
the brave ones among us. All who choose can
enter it. Has any one a test to suggest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was absolute silence. Spotted Tail
knew no one would think of a suitable test on the
spur of the moment. So he proposed one himself,
one that he had had in mind for some days.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>“Suppose, then,” he added, still smiling, “we
cross, one by one, Swinging Bridge, and those
who get over safely will be entitled to be called
brave.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a gasp of surprise and consternation.
Swinging Bridge was a small tree that had
fallen across Rocky Ford where the river cut
deep through a narrow gorge. The tree seemed
almost suspended in mid-air by the vines and
bushes, and was very dangerous. Every wind
swung it back and forth like a hammock strung
between two trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>No rabbit had ever dared to cross it. It was
supposed to be an impossible feat. The tree
was so small and slippery that it afforded small
chance for an animal without claws to walk across
it. It hung fifty feet from the river’s bed so that
a fall from it meant almost sure death.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was foolhardy to try it. Bobby Gray Squirrel
could run across it easily, but that was because
he had claws with which to cling to it.
Sleepy the Opossum and Washer the Raccoon
could likewise walk across the bridge without
fear of falling. But for a rabbit, whose feet were
not made to climb, it was a dangerous undertaking.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, not that!” exclaimed Fuzzy Wuzz,
shuddering.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“Why not?” asked Spotted Tail. “It will
be a wonderful record for any rabbit who can
do it. What do you say, Bumper?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m willing if you are,” Bumper replied,
feeling that he could not withdraw from the challenge.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then we will draw lots to see who goes first,”
promptly added Spotted Tail, who had arranged
the whole thing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That isn’t fair,” interrupted one of Bumper’s
followers. “The challenger should go first.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Since when was drawing lots unfair?”
queried Spotted Tail. “I appeal to your judgment,
Old Blind Rabbit. Isn’t it fair?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old leader of the rabbits hesitated for a
moment, but he had to admit that this form
of selection had been common with his people
as long as he could recollect.</p>

<p class='c011'>So when he decided in favor of Spotted Tail,
the work of choosing their order of going across
the bridge began. There were ten who stepped
forward to accept the challenge. The Old Blind
Rabbit held the sticks as each one stepped up to
choose. Bumper got the short one, either through
chance or through some trick Spotted Tail had
arranged. No one could say which it was, but a
murmur of dissent went up at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It wasn’t a fair drawing!” they cried. “Try
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>it over again. Spotted Tail played a trick on
Bumper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” interrupted Bumper, “we’ll not draw
lots again. I’ll cross Swinging Bridge first.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This decision was accepted with applause, and
the rabbits trooped through the woods to Swinging
Bridge. Bumper’s first sight of it made him
shiver. It was worse than he had imagined. The
chasm was at least thirty feet across, and the
butt end of the tree was not more than eight
inches in diameter, while the smaller end seemed
to dwindle away into a mere whip. In fact, the
tree could never have remained in its position
if it hadn’t been for the vines suspending it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll begin on this end,” Bumper said, choosing
the butt end of the tree. His quick eye had
seen the only possible chance for crossing. Half
way across, where the tree grew smaller rapidly,
there was a crotch which offered a firm footing.
Bumper decided to walk out to this, and then
reach the other side in one tremendous hop. That
would be crossing the bridge, for nothing in the
terms had been said about the manner of going.</p>

<p class='c011'>While the others held their breath, and Fuzzy
Wuzz shook and trembled with fear, Bumper
hopped on the tree, and began making his way
slowly along. He dared not look below where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the river rolled and tossed over the rocks. He
kept his eyes on the crotch ahead.</p>

<p class='c011'>He reached this without accident. Then
paused. The rest of the way was too perilous
for any rabbit to proceed. Spotted Tail smiled
to himself. He knew that it would be the last
of the white rabbit if he attempted it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper crouched low, fastened his hind feet
firmly in the crotch, and then, to the surprise
of all, leaped into the air in one tremendous
spring that carried him clear across to the other
side. His heart was beating at a lively rate, but
when he realized that he had performed the difficult
feat a little glow of triumph spread over
his face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wonderful! Good for Bumper!” were the
cries from the other side that reached his ears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now Spotted Tail, it’s your turn!” some
one said.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Spotted Tail was white and trembling.
He had never expected to be called upon to attempt
it. With the death of Bumper in the
river below, they would call the test off. It would
be suicidal for another to try it. But now all
was changed. Bumper was safe on the other
side, and they were calling on him to cross. He
crouched in abject fear, and seemed ready to ask
for mercy when Bumper spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“No,” he said, “it isn’t safe. It’s a foolhardy
thing to do. I forbid any one else trying it. You
understand, Spotted Tail, I forbid it!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail raised his head hopefully, and a
cunning, cringing expression came into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The king must be obeyed,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then boastfully, walking away: “But I could
have crossed without jumping half the way.
That was not included in the terms of the test.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>
  <h2 class='c012'>STORY VII<br /> <span class='large'>THE TEST OF WITS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Of course, Spotted Tail was glad that he had
been relieved of making the terrible test of
courage in crossing Swinging Bridge, but, at the
same time, he was chagrined that Bumper had
come out of the contest with greater honors than
ever. It seemed as if in some way the white
rabbit managed to make good by successfully
crawling out of every corner in which Spotted
Tail put him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s just luck—blind luck,” growled Spotted
Tail to himself. And so it seemed to him, for
he was unwilling to face the truth, and accept it.
It is always easier to blame luck for our failures,
and Spotted Rabbit was like a good many boys
and girls in this respect.</p>

<p class='c011'>Instead of feeling any gratitude to Bumper
for saving him the humiliation of his life by forbidding
any rabbit to undertake the crossing,
Spotted Tail allowed his rancor to increase day
by day until he was in a fine frame of mind. He
wanted more than ever to “get even” with
Bumper, as he expressed it.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Then one day when the opportunity seemed
to come to him, he was prepared to take advantage
of it. It was to be a test of wits, this time.
Without his knowing it, this was the one ground
on which Bumper was eager to be challenged.
It is to be feared that Bumper had an inordinate
conceit about his ability to get out of difficult
places by using his wits.</p>

<p class='c011'>So when Spotted Tail started in the usual way
to work up to a challenge, Bumper readily encouraged
him. “A good king is always a wise
king, isn’t he, Bumper?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He couldn’t be a good king if he wasn’t wise,”
was the smiling retort.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just so. I agree with you. But what is
wisdom? Can you describe it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you describe the sunlight, Spotted Tail?
You see it every day, and you know it when you
see it. But can you describe it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can describe it by saying that it is just the
opposite of darkness,” Spotted Tail replied, a
little at a loss for a good answer to this unexpected
question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I can describe wisdom in the same way.
It’s the opposite of ignorance.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail frowned when the others laughed
and clapped their paws at this retort.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But what I meant,” continued the discomfitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>rabbit, recovering his composure, “is the
application of wisdom. How do we know a thing
is wise until we’ve tried it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How do we know a thing is hot or cold until
we’ve burnt or frozen our paw? By experience,
Spotted Tail, we know that it isn’t necessary to
run into a fire and scorch ourselves every time
we see one to find out whether it is hot.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Exactly, Bumper, but some things we don’t
know by experience. Suppose you had never
been in the water and didn’t know how to swim,
but you’d seen other animals swim. Now, if you
fell in the water, what would you do? Would
the knowledge that you’d seen others swim save
you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Perhaps,” replied Bumper, hesitatingly.
Then, smiling, he added: “But the first thing I’d
do would be to look around for a raft. That
would be safer than trying to learn to swim.
Don’t you think that would be the wise thing to
do?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, if there was a raft handy. But suppose
there was none in sight. What would you do
then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper stretched himself, and answered lazily:
“I can’t say, Spotted Tail, until I was put
to the test. But I think I’d use my wits or try
to.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>They had been sunning themselves on a board
some hunter had stretched across a bend in the
river. Spotted Tail had lured Bumper to the
far end of the board for his wicked purpose. The
middle of the board rested on a stone, and sometimes
the young rabbits used it as a see-saw.
By running out to the ends two rabbits could
make it jump up and down so that it splashed
in the water and made a great commotion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail was sitting next to Bumper on
the far end which stretched over very deep water.
He turned now to him, and asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Can you swim, Bumper? Were you ever
in the water over your head?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” Bumper answered truthfully, “but
some day I must learn. I think I’ll begin to take
lessons.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, to-day is as good as any day to begin,”
replied Spotted Tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before Bumper realized what he meant by this
remark, he leaped high in the air, and landed on
the other end of the spring-board with a thud.
The result was that Bumper was shot straight
up into the air nearly two feet right over the
deepest part of the river. He turned a complete
somersault in the air, and made a frantic struggle
to reach the end of the board as he came down.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>But he missed it by a foot, and fell plump in the
river.</p>

<p class='c011'>He went down, down, down out of sight. It
seemed an age before he came up again, wet, bedraggled
and puffing. The fright caused by his
sudden ducking threatened to make him panicky,
and his first thought was to squeal for help and
splash around like a child in a bathtub.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Spotted Tail’s words aroused him.
“Now, Bumper,” he called, “you’ve got a chance
to use your wits. Let me see what you can do
to get ashore.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a cruel, cold-blooded thing to do, and
the other rabbits who had seen the whole thing
from the shore came scurrying to the rescue,
shouting: “Shame! Shame on you, Spotted
Tail!”</p>

<p class='c011'>But, of course, this didn’t help Bumper any.
The water was very deep where he had fallen in,
and there wasn’t the sign of anything that could
be used as a raft. Could he swim? Not much!
By frantic efforts he could keep his head above
water. Nearly every wild animal can do this
even when a tiny baby. But that wouldn’t get
him to the shore until he was exhausted.</p>

<p class='c011'>But just when he was beginning to feel that
he would drown his hind feet touched something.
It was a big rock in the middle of the stream
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>which could not be seen from the spring-board
or the shore. Bumper found that by standing
on his two hind feet on the rock, he could just
keep his head and neck above the surface. This
gave him sudden courage, and a thought. He
stood stock still on the rock, and turned to the
one who had thrown him in.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is much more dignified for a king to float
upright, Spotted Tail,” he said, “than to swim.
Can you stand in the water like this?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail and the others were amazed by
the sight of Bumper standing perfectly still in
the deep water, with his head and neck just above
the surface.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come now, Spotted Tail, you have challenged
me to everything you could think of,” continued
Bumper. “Now it is your turn to accept
my challenge. Either show me that you can
stand in the deep water, or desist from further
attempts to humiliate me. You must do one or
the other, or I shall hold your challenges in contempt
hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, Spotted Tail knew he could never
perform this miracle, and he was at a loss to understand
how Bumper could do it. “Then,” continued
Bumper when he showed no intention of
coming in, “you are disgraced before all of your
people.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>All the while Bumper had been watching for
a way to get ashore. He had been feeling with
his hind legs for other rocks in the deep river.
To his joy he found one, and quickly stepped to
it. There was a series of stepping-stones, which
hunters used to cross the river when it was shallow.
They were hidden from view now by the
flood. Bumper made his way cautiously from
one to the other until he reached shallow water,
and then he hopped gracefully ashore, much to
Spotted Tail’s chagrin.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>STORY VIII<br /> <span class='large'>SPOTTED TAIL STIRS UP REVOLT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Spotted Tail was in disgrace. Not only had
he wickedly thrown Bumper into the deep water
in full view of all the others, but he had refused
to accept the first challenge made to him. He
knew that he could never live down both. One
was enough to bring him into contempt, but the
two together practically robbed him of all further
influence among his people.</p>

<p class='c011'>But instead of accepting his disgrace in a contrite
spirit, he became moody and sullen. When
the others, including Fuzzy Wuzz, avoided him,
and passed him in silence, he gnashed his teeth in
a fine rage.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he very naturally laid all the blame to
Bumper, excusing himself from any guilt. This
did not improve his manners any, and finally,
satisfied that he could get no sympathy in his
home burrow, he decided to seek revenge outside.</p>

<p class='c011'>He would spread the tale among all his people
in the woods that the white rabbit was a fraud,
and that it was his intention to make them all
submit to his rule. This would naturally cause
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>general anger, and perhaps stir up a revolt. The
coming of Bumper in the woods had not reached
far. Rumors spread slowly unless taken up by
the birds, and Bumper had made no attempt to
interest them in his cause. He was too busy
learning the ways of the woods and the duties
of a king and leader.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail decided to get ahead of him and
spread the news first, distorting it to suit his
purpose. He appealed to Rusty the Blackbird
first. “Rusty, you’ve always been a friend of
mine,” he said, meeting him one day. “Now,
will you do me a great favor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me what it is first, Spotted Tail,” was
the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is this, Rusty. Bumper the White Rabbit
has come into the woods from somewhere, and
proclaimed himself king of all the rabbits. He
is a cruel king, and intends to wage warfare upon
all the burrows that do not submit to his rule. I
want you to spread the news all over the woods,
and warn all leaders of burrows to rise in revolt.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rusty looked at the speaker, and flirted his
wings. “No, no, Spotted Tail,” he replied.
“I’m no carrier of evil messages. Besides, I’ve
met Bumper the White Rabbit, and I liked him.
He didn’t seem to me cruel or a bad sort of
fellow.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Spotted Tail appealed next to Mr. Woodpecker,
who listened to his story in silence, and
then tapped the trunk of a tree with his long,
hard bill. “No, no, no!” he said, keeping time
with his taps. “I don’t believe your story,
Spotted Tail. Bumper’s not that kind. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail looked disappointed. He was
very sore and grouchy. It seemed as if the birds
as well as the rabbits were all against him. Why
did they all like Bumper the White Rabbit so
much?</p>

<p class='c011'>He met Towhee the Chewink next, and approached
her with a smile and friendly greeting,
but when he had stated his grievance, and made
his request, modest little Towhee laughed in his
face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve got better business than spreading such
news,” she replied. “You’ll have to find another
messenger.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In turn Spotted Tail approached Piney the
Purple Finch, Mrs. Phœbe Bird and Mr. Crested
Flycatcher, and received from each one the same
reply. None of them would undertake the work
of stirring up a revolt against Bumper.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>It was Shrike, the Butcher Bird, whose very name made him dreaded and hated</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>He was in despair, and was bemoaning his luck
when suddenly a voice startled him. “What’s
the matter, Spotted Tail? You look black
enough to obscure the sun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was Shrike the Butcher Bird, whose very
name made him dreaded and hated. Shrike had
the unpleasant habit of catching insects, lizards,
frogs, and sometimes small birds, and sticking
them on thorns until he or his mate was ready to
eat them. This disgusting and cruel habit made
him an outcast among the birds, and very few
would have anything to do with him. Naturally,
it soured his disposition, and made him irritable
and unfriendly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail looked up and a gleam of hope
entered his eyes. Why not ask the Shrike to
spread the message that would stir up trouble?
By so doing he would accomplish two things. He
would get even with the birds who had refused
to listen to his plea, and accomplish the downfall
of Bumper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have enough trouble to make me look blue,”
Spotted Tail replied. “Even the brightness of
the sun doesn’t make me feel happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It must be trouble indeed, then,” laughed the
Shrike, “for it’s a beautiful day, and everybody
else feels happy. What is it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Alack! And alas!” sighed the rabbit. “I’m
afraid you won’t sympathize with me any more
than Mr. Woodpecker or Rusty the Blackbird
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>or any of the others. I have told my tale to
them, and they only laught at me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A wicked gleam flashed from the eyes of Shrike
the Butcher Bird. “Rusty and Mr. Woodpecker
are self-conceited birds, and what they think
don’t amount to much. Little I’d care what
they said or did.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But they won’t carry my message,” added
Spotted Tail. “And if no one will do it how
can I save the rabbits of the woods from the terrible
thing that is coming to them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is this terrible thing?” queried the
Shrike, growing interested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s about Bumper the White Rabbit,” continued
the dejected rabbit, sighing heavily. “He
has come into the woods to rule over all my
people, and he is a cruel, selfish king. He intends
to make all of us his slaves. He won’t listen to
reason, but says he’s appointed to rule, and any
one who disputes his right he will drive from the
woods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Shrike smiled. “Why don’t you drive
him from the woods?” he asked. “I never knew
you to be afraid of anything. I’d quickly put
an end to his rule.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite right, Mr. Shrike. I would do it if
it was only Bumper I had to fight. But he has
come into our burrow, and by tricks and strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>ways won over Old Blind Rabbit, Fuzzy Wuzz,
Goggle Eyes, and all the others. They’re going
to help him to rule in the woods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! Hum!” mused the Shrike. “So that’s
the trouble! You’re the only good rabbit in the
burrow?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, no, I didn’t mean that,” protested Spotted
Tail. “I’m no better than the others, but he
couldn’t deceive me. I saw through his tricks,
and because I opposed him I’m in disfavor.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And what is this message you want me to
carry to the rest of the rabbits in the woods?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wish to put them on their guard so Bumper
cannot deceive them. If they would rise in their
might they could overwhelm him even if all my
family backed him up. If a revolt isn’t begun
right away, he will win them by degrees, and
then it will be too late.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Rusty and Mr. Woodpecker refused to
carry the message?” queried the Shrike.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” sighed Spotted Tail. “I don’t believe
they like me. I’ve never been very friendly with
the birds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Shrike the Butcher Bird hesitated for a moment
to impale a worm on a thorn for future use,
and then said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, Spotted Tail. I’ll carry the message
to every rabbit burrow in the woods.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“Oh, Shrike, you’re so kind!” exclaimed
Spotted Tail; but the bird interrupted him with
a harsh laugh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It isn’t because I like you, Spotted Tail,” he
said, “that I’m doing this, but just to spite the
other birds. I’ll punish them for scorning and
disliking me. That’s why I do it. Good-bye!
I’ll begin spreading the news right away.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
  <h2 class='c012'>STORY IX<br /> <span class='large'>THE WORK OF SHRIKE THE BUTCHER BIRD</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Shrike the Butcher Bird was as good as his
word. He was a vindictive bird, and it actually
gave him pleasure in spreading Spotted Tail’s
message because all the other birds had refused.
First he went to White Tail at the far end of
the woods, for he knew that White Tail was a
big rabbit who, at one time, had had trouble with
the Old Blind Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, White Tail,” called the Shrike, “here
is news for you! Bumper the White Rabbit has
been proclaimed king of the woods by Old Blind
Rabbit, and he intends to make all of you his
slaves.”</p>

<p class='c011'>White Tail reared himself on his hind legs, and
clicked his teeth. “If you’d come with good
news, Shrike, I wouldn’t have believed you; but
as the carrier of bad news I think there must
be something in it. Who sent you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spotted Tail.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! Spotted Tail! I never did like him,
but I never knew him to spread false news. If
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>Bumper comes to interfere with my family, he
will—Well,” leering, “I will tell him what I
think of him. Good-day, Shrike, and much
obliged for your trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Next, Shrike the Butcher Bird interviewed
Brindley the Lame, so named because of a limp
he had from infancy. Brindley was a good-natured
rabbit, and ruled over his burrow with
kindness, and was loved wherever he went.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, Brindley!” cried Shrike, when he met
him in front of his burrow sunning himself.
“You look well to-day, and as fat as butter. Too
bad to spoil your rest with bad news.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bad news never spoil my rest,” was the
grinning reply. “I always sleep over it, and
then when I wake up I find it isn’t so bad as it
seemed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, you’ll think differently when I tell you
this. All the rabbits in the woods are rising in
revolt against Bumper the White Rabbit that
has come here to rule over them as king.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed! Who are all the rabbits you speak
of?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spotted Tail, White Tail, and many others.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! Um!” sighed Brindley. “Then
Bumper’d better look out. I wouldn’t want to
be wearing his crown.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But aren’t you going to join the revolt?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>asked the Shrike. “Or are you so good-natured
you’d submit to any tyrant who came along?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m never so good-natured as when I’m thinking
seriously, Shrike,” was the retort. “Now,
I’ll tell you what I’ll do. I’ll sleep over it, and
then I won’t do anything hasty.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was Crooked Ears, a big rabbit who
ruled over a family of twenty in a burrow buried
deep under the cliff; Pink Nose, whose family
was noted for the remarkably pinkish tinge that
decorated the tips of their noses; and Rolly Polly,
who was so round and fat that he could roll down
a hill faster than he could run. They lived in
different parts of the woods, and it took all the
morning for the Shrike to find them and spread
the news.</p>

<p class='c011'>They accepted the tale with different degrees
of surprise and distrust. Rolly Polly was too
fat and pleasant to let it worry him much, and
Pink Nose was more interested in what Bumper
looked like than his mission in the woods. When
the Shrike explained that he was a pure white
rabbit, with pink eyes, Pink Nose eagerly asked:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What’s the color of his nose?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Knowing his fondness for pink-nosed rabbits,
and fearing that he might claim kinship with
Bumper if he said he had a pink nose, Shrike purposely
stretched the truth.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“It is all white, the same as his fur—everything
white except his pink eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Pink Nose looked disappointed. “I wish he
had a pink nose,” he said sadly. “Then I’d know
he was related to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pink! Oh! Ho!” laughed the Shrike. “He
hates pink-nosed rabbits.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who told you that?” snapped Pink Nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spotted Tail!” he lied without blinking.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pink Nose’s eyes turned a dark green, and the
Shrike flew away, knowing that he had planted
the seeds of discord in the mind of a perfectly
good-natured rabbit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Crooked Ears was a big surly rabbit, whose
disposition had been spoilt when very young by
an accident which had twisted his ears so they
looked more like pretzels than anything else.
The Shrike was quick to detect Crooked Ears’
weak point. He was forever trying to hide his
crooked ears, and he lay stretched out in the sun
with his paws drawn up over them as if ashamed
to have any one see them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Shrike told him the news, but Crooked
Ears said peevishly: “Oh, go away! Don’t disturb
me now. I’m very sleepy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Shrike whistled and fluttered his tail
feathers in disdain. “All right, Crooked Ears,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>he added. “I thought you’d like to know of the
revolt, and of Bumper’s threat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What was his threat?” asked Crooked Ears,
sleepily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That he’d bite and twist the ears of every
rabbit that opposed him until they all looked like
yours.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He said that!” growled Crooked Ears, rising.
“He made fun of my ears!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Made fun of them! Oh! Ho! What a
joke! Listen, Crooked Ears, and I’ll tell you
what he said about them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Crooked Ears seemed to be all ears now, for
his anger was aroused. “He said,” continued
the Shrike, “that all rabbits with crooked ears
should be run from the woods. They were not
fit to live with rabbits that had good, straight
ears. Does that interest you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t believe you!” snapped Crooked Ears,
but the Shrike only laughed shrilly, and flew
away to find another burrow. He knew that he
had angered Crooked Ears and poisoned his mind
against Bumper.</p>

<p class='c011'>All the day he flew from burrow to burrow,
spreading the evil news, until by night every
rabbit in the woods knew of Bumper’s coming,
and believed that he was going to declare himself
king and make every one of his people a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>slave. There was a pow-wow that night in every
burrow, and the talk of what to do ran high.
Some were angry and indignant; others more
amused than angry, and a few so belligerent that
they wanted to set out on the war path at once.</p>

<p class='c011'>When the Shrike returned to Spotted Tail, he
gleefully told all that he had done, and seemed
greatly amused by the latter’s joy. Spotted Tail
thanked him over and over again until the
Shrike’s amusement was uncontrollable. He
laughed and whistled as if it were a very great
joke. Then, cocking his head sideways, he
added:</p>

<p class='c011'>“You needn’t thank me, Spotted Tail, for I
didn’t do it to please you. It was just to spite
the other birds.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just the same you have done me a great
favor, and I’m grateful for it,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Favor! Favor, you call it! Ha! Ha! Ha!
Wait and see, Spotted Tail. My mission isn’t
done yet.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You haven’t told all the rabbits?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and now I’m going to tell all the animals—Buster
the Bear, Mr. Fox, Billy the
Mink, Washer the Raccoon, and all the others.
There’ll be a right merry time when they see you
fighting among yourselves. I think Mr. Fox
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and Buster may take a hand in it. What a chance
they’ll have for a good meal!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And still laughing shrilly, he flew away, leaving
Spotted Tail in a very unpleasant frame of
mind. Suppose the other animals should take
advantage of the revolt to pounce upon the rabbits.
How much innocent blood would be spilled
because of his trickery!</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>
  <h2 class='c012'>STORY X<br /> <span class='large'>RUSTY WARNS BUMPER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Of course, Bumper knew nothing about the
revolt that Spotted Tail had stirred up in the
woods against him. After all, he felt a little
sympathy for Spotted Tail when all the others
began to ignore him and give him the cold shoulder.
But really there was nothing he could do,
for Spotted Tail had brought the trouble all on
himself because of his envy and spite.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Being a king isn’t all lettuce and carrots,”
sighed Bumper. “I’m not sure but I’d rather
be just Fuzzy Wuzz, who smiles and laughs all
day, or even Goggle Eyes, who eats altogether
too much for himself, but seems to enjoy it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then there’s so much a king has to know,”
he added a moment later. “I’m learning all the
time new things, but what I don’t know yet
frightens me. I wish sometimes I could take a
vacation, and just go off and forget everything.
I wonder why kings don’t have vacations.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Such a thing as a vacation for a king was unheard
of, although all of the rest could take any
day they chose. Bumper couldn’t even steal out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>of the burrow alone for a little run without somebody
going with him. The king had to be
watched and accompanied all the time.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now Old Blind Rabbit, in proclaiming
Bumper the White Rabbit king, had thought
first of only his own family, for he had no control
over the other burrows; but he was so well
known for his wisdom and age that the leaders
of other burrows would listen to his words. He
had wanted to keep Bumper’s coming a secret
until he was sure that he had made no mistake
in choosing him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But now he thought was a good time to take
him around to his friends—Brindley the Lame,
Pink Nose, Rolly Polly and Crooked Ears. He
wanted them to meet Bumper and judge for
themselves. As leaders of their families, they
knew the prophecy of the coming of a white
rabbit, who some day would rule over all their
people and redeem them from their weak ways.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bumper, my days are numbered, but yours
are as many as the trees in the woods,” he said
to the White Rabbit. “Before I go I want to
see you accepted as king by Pink Nose, Rolly
Polly, Crooked Ears, Brindley the Lame and
White Tail. Then I can die in peace.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper nodded his head, and asked who all
these important people were.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“They are leaders of big families here in the
woods, and very influential. If they accept you
all the other rabbits will follow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if they don’t?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I fear there will be trouble. You cannot
rule over a divided people and make them
happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This bit of wisdom could not be disputed, and
Bumper added sadly: “Neither can the ruler be
happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well said, Bumper. But the time has come
now when we must call on them. I shall take
you in person, and explain to White Tail and
the others the meaning of our call.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This idea rather frightened Bumper. To meet
so many important leaders, and carry himself as
a king should, made him feel like quitting. Just
for an instant he thought of the red-headed girl
and her wonderful garden, and wished he was
back with her. How delightful it would be to do
nothing all day long but eat and receive her petting!
He even thought he might be happier
with the old woman back in the city.</p>

<p class='c011'>But only for an instant did his thoughts thus
play truant. He was a king now, with duties to
perform, and he wasn’t going to prove unequal
to them. Bumper had very fine qualities, which,
after all, fitted him for a ruler more than his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>pink eyes and white fur. Goodness and wisdom
were better than fine clothes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper had been learning rapidly the ways
of his people in the woods, and he was quite
familiar with many things that had before
startled him. He had learned to know the difference
between the good and bad plants, so
there was no longer any danger of his poisoning
himself. He had met Washer the Raccoon, and
had made the acquaintance of Sleepy the Opossum.
He was on good speaking terms with Mr.
Beaver, and Billy the Mink had put himself out
to compare his fur with his own beautiful coat.</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew every trail in the woods, and could
scent Mr. Fox from afar. He had even learned
to swim, which he considered necessary for his
health. The birds were his friends, and he had
learned much from them. Frequently they
brought him news which guided him in his work.</p>

<p class='c011'>A few days after the Old Blind Rabbit had
announced his intention of introducing Bumper
to White Tail and the others, Rusty the Black
Bird appeared near the burrow, and perched
himself on the top of the rock until the white
rabbit appeared.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hello, Bumper!” he called.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-morning, Rusty!” replied Bumper.
“It’s a long time since I’ve seen you.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“If you’d arrange to see me oftener,” was the
retort, “you wouldn’t get in so much trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, Rusty, but I didn’t know I was
in trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh!” whistled Rusty. “Some people don’t
know when they are in trouble.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then it shouldn’t bother them,” laughed
Bumper. “If you don’t know you have any
trouble, why worry?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That may be good enough for a king, but it
would never do for common people. We must
be hunting for trouble all the time to avoid it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you hunt for it you’ll generally find it.
No, I don’t believe in looking for what you don’t
want.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Rusty was a little provoked at what he took
as a personal rebuke, and was half inclined to
fly away; but Bumper’s smile changed his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Just to show you that trouble comes whether
you hunt for it or not, I’m going to tell you something,”
he added. “You’re going to be in a peck
of trouble soon, Bumper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s much better than being in a bushel,
isn’t it?” he laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, stop your joking, and be serious. This
is a serious matter for you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All right, I’m listening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, then, Spotted Tail has been spreading
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>false rumors about you. He asked me to carry
the message, but I refused, and he asked Mr.
Woodpecker and Towhee the Chewink. They
told me so. But they wouldn’t listen to him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’m very grateful for that, and you can tell
Towhee and Mr. Woodpecker so. But if nobody
carried the news how did it get abroad?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mr. Shrike the Butcher Bird carried it just
because we wouldn’t. And after telling all the
rabbits he told the news to Mr. Fox and Buster
the Bear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is the news he told?” asked Bumper,
gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a few words Rusty told him, and when he
was through Bumper was graver than before.
It pained him to think that Spotted Tail would
betray him, and it made him sad to believe that
his words could stir up discord among the rabbits.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thank you, Rusty,” he said in conclusion.
“I’m glad to know it. Forewarned is forearmed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh! Ho!” laughed Rusty. “Now you begin
to change your mind about trouble. But
you don’t have to hunt for it. It’s coming soon.
It’s here now!”</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>STORY XI<br /> <span class='large'>THE RABBITS RISE AGAINST BUMPER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Forewarned by Rusty, Bumper was partly
prepared for the trouble that was brewing, but
not so Old Blind Rabbit. Bumper had intended
to tell him the truth, but he didn’t want to raise
unnecessary alarm. Perhaps, after all, Rusty
had exaggerated the danger, and nothing would
come of Spotted Tail’s work.</p>

<p class='c011'>So one morning he was greatly disturbed when
there was a noise outside the burrow made by the
pattering of many little feet. It was Goggle
Eyes who brought the information in to Old
Blind Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is something in the wind, Old Blind
Rabbit!” he exclaimed in excitement. “All the
rabbits of the woods have come to visit us.
There’s White Tail, with his huge family; Pink
Nose and all his big sons; Crooked Ears, looking
surly and angry; Brindley the Lame, Rolly
Polly, and—oh!—many, many more!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Blind Rabbit did not get excited. It was
the way with him. Instead of always looking for
trouble, he expected the best of everything.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>“Perhaps it means,” he replied, after a moment’s
thought, “that they have heard of
Bumper’s coming, and they have come to meet
him. I shall go out and see them. They’re all
welcome.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They don’t look very friendly,” stammered
Goggle Eyes. “They look and act positively
rude. I don’t believe their coming is for any
good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tut! Tut! You’re always looking for the
worst, Goggle Eyes. Now I’ll go out and greet
my brother leaders. Lend me a paw, Goggle
Eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” interrupted Bumper, who had heard
the conversation. “You must let me go out
first. I’ll speak to them, and if there’s trouble—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spoken like a king, Bumper,” interrupted
Old Blind Rabbit, “but I should meet White
Tail and his friends first. They know me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Listen!” added Bumper. “I have not told
you before because I didn’t believe anything
would come of it. But there may be trouble outside.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What trouble, Bumper? You mustn’t follow
the ways of Goggle Eyes, and look for evil in
everything.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper knew that he ought to tell, and
straightway, without hesitation, he related all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>that Rusty had told him. Old Blind Rabbit
listened in silence, but not without surprise and
trembling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is Spotted Tail?” he asked in a voice
of thunder when Bumper had finished.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail was nowhere around. Nobody
knew where he was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has betrayed us!” added Old Blind Rabbit,
solemnly. “He has spread false news to our
friends, and used Shrike the Butcher Bird as his
messenger. Alack! And alas! that I should live
to see this day!”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Old Blind Rabbit dropped back
on his haunches and looked very sad and depressed.
His age told on him, and his breath
came slow and hard. Finally arousing himself,
he continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“If Spotted Tail has stirred up a revolt, the
truth must be told. I will see the leaders. They
will listen to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, let me go!” interrupted Bumper again.
“If there’s any danger on my account, I must
face it, and not you, Old Blind Rabbit.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They will not harm me, but in their passion
they might do something to you, Bumper. It is
the part of wisdom that I should see them first.
Isn’t it so?”</p>

<p class='c011'>All the others agreed to this, and much against
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>his will Bumper stayed in the burrow, while Old
Blind Rabbit was led outside by Goggle Eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>And what a sight it was outside the burrow!
All the wild rabbits of the woods were assembled
there. White Tail, Pink Nose, Crooked Ears,
Brindley the Lame, Rolly Polly and a lot of
other leaders were there with all their followers.
The woods around the rock were literally alive
with rabbits.</p>

<p class='c011'>They were packed ten deep around the big
rock, and scattered in groups all through the surrounding
bushes. And on every face there was
an angry, defiant look, and in every eye sullen
discontent. Old Blind Rabbit could not see all
these sights, but he sensed them before any one
spoke. Then a babel of sounds greeted his ears.
They were so many, and so confusing, that nobody
could understand anybody else.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finally Old Blind Rabbit reared himself on
his haunches, and raised a paw for silence. “Listen,”
he called. “There’s no sense in jabbering
like silly babies. What is the trouble? Don’t all
speak at once, but—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where’s Bumper the White Rabbit!” they
shouted back in unison.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once more the senseless chatter made the air
ring until Brindley the Lame took a tree stump
and signalled for silence. “This isn’t a tea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>party,” he said, smiling, “and we shouldn’t waste
time talking like a lot of magpies. Let some of
the leaders speak for all.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was instant silence, and hundreds of
heads were nodded. Brindley then continued:</p>

<p class='c011'>“As for my part, I’m not sure but we’re all
here on a fool’s errand. I never knew the Shrike
to carry news that did any one good. However,
we’re here, and a big crowd we are. We’ve
brought all of our families with us, big and little,
and I’m glad to see them—Mrs. White Tail with
her children, and Mrs. Pink Nose—”</p>

<p class='c011'>Brindley’s jollying pleased the younger rabbits,
and they began to laugh and applaud; but
not so the leaders. Crooked Ears rose up, and
interrupted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come to the point, Brindley! We’re here to
drive Bumper the White Rabbit from the woods.
That’s the long and short of it. Am I not
right?”</p>

<p class='c011'>A terrifying shout greeted these words, and
for a moment it seemed as if bedlam had broken
loose. Even Old Blind Rabbit was frightened,
and he trembled so that Goggle Eyes was afraid
he would fall down.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What has Bumper done that you should want
to drive him from the woods?” was all that Old
Blind Rabbit could say.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>“It’s not what he’s done,” roared White Tail,
leaping to the top of a fallen tree. “It’s what
he’s going to do. He’ll not be king of the
woods!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“NO! No!” shouted a hundred voices.
“We’ll not be his slaves! We’ll not follow him!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Listen, friends!” Old Blind Rabbit called
back. “You have been deceived. Spotted Tail
has spread false rumors. He knew they were
false, and he couldn’t get Rusty or Mr. Woodpecker
or Towhee or any of the birds, who were
his friends, to carry the message to you. Then
when they all failed him he appealed to Shrike
the Butcher Bird.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He paused, and looked with his sightless eyes
over the big assemble. Then, raising his voice,
he continued: “Since when have you come to believe
what Shrike tells! When has he ever spread
anything but lies in the woods? He has no
friends among the birds—”</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly there was a commotion on the outskirts
of the crowd. Shrike flew in their midst
and whistled sharply. Then out of the bushes
crashed Buster the Bear, followed by Mr. Fox.
Screams and shouts went up from all sides as
every rabbit scurried for cover. They ran pell-mell
hither and thither, with Mr. Fox and Buster
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>after them, laughing in their glee at the fright
they had caused.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was a miracle that some were not killed, for
it hardly seemed there were enough hiding-places
in the woods to conceal them. Old Blind Rabbit
stumbled back in his burrow, and invited as many
to follow him as the place would hold.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>STORY XII<br /> <span class='large'>SPOTTED TAIL RECEIVES HIS PUNISHMENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Yes, it was certainly a miracle that there
wasn’t a great slaughter of rabbits in the woods
when Buster and Mr. Fox broke up the huge
assemble! To this day they marvel at it. The
only explanation the leaders could give was that
Mr. Fox and Buster the Bear were more interested
in frightening them than in killing. So
they bowled over as many as they could, and
didn’t stop to bite any of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>What a crowded house Old Blind Rabbit had,
though! Every rabbit who could squeeze
through the doorway had followed him in the
burrow. It was the most mixed audience ever
gathered in one burrow.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were followers of Pink Nose huddling
alongside of Rolly Polly’s family, and Brindley
the Lame was crowded next to White Tail.
They were packed in so tight that it was difficult
for any one to move.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper was crowded way in back alongside
Fuzzy Wuzz. Not understanding the great
noise, Bumper had at first stood by the entrance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>to fight back any intruders that followed Old
Blind Rabbit. He thought they were crowding
in the burrow to get him.</p>

<p class='c011'>But Goggle Eyes and Fuzzy Wuzz understood
his mistake, and they took him by the paws
and forced him to the back part of the burrow.
“It’s Mr. Fox and Buster the Bear!” cried
Fuzzy Wuzz in his ears.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper understood immediately, and his
wrath turned to kindness. He helped to make
room for all the strangers that came pell-mell in
the burrow. The excitement didn’t quiet down
at once. Shivering with terror at their narrow
escape, every one squealed, and tried to talk at
once.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was danger of the little ones being
trampled upon and hurt until the leaders began
to get their senses back. “Stop crowding!”
shouted White Tail. “We’re safe in here! Now
every one keep quiet while we think.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was so quiet that one could almost hear
their thoughts, but they were so confused that it
wouldn’t have done much good. No one could
have made head or tail out of them. It was Old
Blind Rabbit who first got over his scare, and
came to his senses.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How many are here?” he asked, turning to
the others for an answer to his question.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“So many we can’t count them,” replied
Goggle Eyes. “My, I was never in such a crowd
before in all my life!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is White Tail here?” continued Old Blind
Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I squeezed in at the last minute, and
lost a handful of fur in doing it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Pink Nose?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here!” came the answer from a corner.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And Brindley the Lame?” continued Old
Blind Rabbit, as if calling the roll of all his
friends.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rolly Polly?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Crooked Ears?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Blind Rabbit stopped for a moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now, as there is no danger of further interruption
by Mr. Fox or Buster,” he added finally,
“we might proceed with our business. We were
talking about Shrike the Butcher Bird when we
were interrupted. I asked you then when had
Shrike carried other than lies and evil news.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never!” shouted some one, and others started
up with various cries. “He deceived us! He
summoned Mr. Fox and Buster the Bear to kill
us! I shall never believe him again!”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>A faint smile spread over Old Blind Rabbit’s
face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, if that’s true,” he continued, “how can
you believe the rumors he spread in the woods
about Bumper the White Rabbit? Were they
not lies too?”</p>

<p class='c011'>This question caused a sudden sensation. No
one had quite thought of this. If Shrike had betrayed
them to Mr. Fox and Buster, why could
it not be true that the whole story was part of
a trick made up by him?</p>

<p class='c011'>“But Spotted Tail sent the news by him,”
said White Tail suddenly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shrike said so, but did you see Spotted Tail
himself?” asked Old Blind Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why, no, I didn’t see him,” replied White
Tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor I! Nor I!” spoke up Pink Nose, Rolly
Polly, and all the others in turn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then,” resumed Old Blind Rabbit, “how do
we know that the whole story wasn’t invented by
Shrike to stir up trouble?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That’s so,” laughed Brindley. “I never
thought of that. But where’s Spotted Tail? Let
him speak for himself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This was just the thing that Spotted Tail,
crouching and trembling in a corner, dreaded the
most. He was so shaken and horrified by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>result of his treachery that he had to be pushed
forward when they called him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell us the truth, Spotted Tail,” said Old
Blind Rabbit severely. “You’re on trial now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There is some good even in the worst of us, and
although Spotted Tail had done many wicked
things, he still possessed a sense of honor. He
could have lied out of it, and declared his innocence,
for no one had direct evidence that he had
started the wicked stories, except the birds. Yes,
he could easily have cleared his skirts by declaring
that Shrike had made up the whole story, and
that he knew nothing of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>But he was frightened and repentant. He was
no longer defiant. He looked so humiliated that
some of the gentler rabbits pitied him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll tell the truth,” he stammered finally. “I
did start the story, and ask Shrike to spread it.
I was jealous of Bumper, and wanted to have
him driven from the woods. I am sorry now, but
that won’t help what’s happened.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” replied Old Blind Rabbit severely,
“after the milk is spilt it does no good to cry
over it. You betrayed your own people, and
nearly caused the death of many of them. Now
what punishment do you think you deserve?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail hung his head in fear and humiliation.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“There is only one punishment to suit the
case,” Old Blind Rabbit said after a pause, “and
that is to be banished from the woods. Never
again can you speak to any of your people, nor
shall they speak to you. Go, Spotted Tail, go,
and never return! Is that not a just punishment?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes! Yes!” cried many, and the leaders of
the burrows shook their heads in assent.</p>

<p class='c011'>But before he could retire from the burrow
in shame and disgrace, Bumper hopped from his
corner, and faced the assembly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One minute, Old Blind Rabbit,” he said.
“Let me speak a word for Spotted Tail. His
sinning was against me most, and I should be
heard. He is repentant now, and we should
give him another chance. I ask you to take back
that sentence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Blind Rabbit looked hard and severe, as
he shook his head. “Sentence has been passed,”
he said sternly, “and justice demands that
Spotted Tail be banished from the woods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But justice tempered with mercy is what I’m
asking for,” replied Bumper.</p>

<p class='c011'>Again Old Blind Rabbit shook his head, and
White Tail, Crooked Ears and the others agreed
with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then,” resumed Bumper sadly, “I shall go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>with him. If you banish Spotted Tail from the
woods you banish me too.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The consternation that followed this remark
was so great you could have heard a pin drop.
Every one was looking at the white rabbit, and, as
if fascinated by his pink eyes and white fur, they
remained mute and awed. Finally Old Blind
Rabbit, seeing his opportunity, said: “What the
king says must be obeyed!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, what the king says must be obeyed!”
cried many as if they were hypnotized, and even
White Tail and the other leaders offered no opposition.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Long live Bumper the White Rabbit as our
king!” quavered Old Blind Rabbit, his voice
cracking.</p>

<p class='c011'>And every one took up the cry. “Long live
Bumper the White Rabbit as our king!”</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>STORY XIII<br /> <span class='large'>BUMPER WINS SPOTTED TAIL’S FRIENDSHIP</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>So Bumper became king of all the rabbits in
the woods, and all his people vowed they would
stand loyally by him, and the big leaders—White
Tail, Pink Nose, Crooked Ears, Brindley the
Lame and Rolly Polly—promised to obey him,
and teach their children and their children’s children
to love and follow him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A king who is merciful to those who hurt him
is a good and wise king,” said White Tail, as he
came forward to pay homage.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wisdom is greater than courage,” said Brindley,
“but greater than either is mercy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I believed pink noses were the signs of royalty
in rabbits,” remarked Pink Nose, when his
turn came next, “but pink eyes are more to be
desired, and I shall teach my children the truth
of this.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Surely,” said Rolly Polly, his eyes twinkling,
“this is a great day for the rabbits of the North
Woods, and anything I can say will never be remembered.
But I hope my next dinner will disagree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>with me if I ever speak an ill word of our
king.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Brindley was smiling and chuckling too, when
he walked up. The sudden happy turn of affairs
was much to his liking. “O Bumper, our white
king!” he exclaimed. “The winter’s snow is not
whiter than your coat, and your soul is whiter
than either. May neither ever fade or grow tarnished
in the use.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Crooked Ears, who had come to the assembly
with a grouch, which he intended to vent upon
Bumper, stood hesitating a moment before he
bowed and took the king’s paw. Then he looked
up and smiled. “Ears, O Bumper, are given
to hear, and whether they are crooked or straight
they should gather in the truth and not the lies.
Mine have heard the truth to-day, and may they
grow more crooked if they ever listen to the untruth
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, when the leaders had finished swearing
their allegiance to Bumper, the others crowded
forward, and for half an hour poor Bumper had
a hard time of it. They wanted to shake his
paw and feel of his soft fur, and gaze into his
pink eyes, until it seemed as if their curiosity
would never be satisfied. And Bumper was in
more danger of being spoilt by flattery than
ever before in his life! From a secret corner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Fuzzy Wuzz watched him through her mild
brown eyes, and at times she frowned. If her
eyes could have spoken they would have said
something like this: “Can he stand all that flattery
and admiration? I’m afraid for him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But Bumper did stand it, for when the visitors
began to leave, one by one, and the burrow became
emptied once more, he drew a heavy sigh
of relief. He turned to Fuzzy Wuzz, who was
still watching him, and said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s been an exciting day, Fuzzy Wuzz,
hasn’t it? And I for one am glad it’s over, but
gladder because all’s ended well. There’ll be no
more trouble in the woods among our own
people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Not a word about the remarkable tribute to his
looks and wisdom, or anything about the high
position they had placed him in. He was still
plain Bumper when with his own family.</p>

<p class='c011'>“O Bumper,” exclaimed Fuzzy Wuzz, “I was
so afraid—afraid—”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Afraid! Afraid of what, Fuzzy Wuzz?” he
asked in surprise when she stopped.</p>

<p class='c011'>Instead of answering directly, she laughed, and
said:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, nothing! I meant I’m so happy!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I am too. Whatever makes you happy
I like.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>But while he smiled into her meek brown eyes,
he happened to catch a glimpse of Spotted Tail
crouching in a corner, looking so miserable and
forlorn that his heart smote him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He left Fuzzy Wuzz, and hopped directly over
to him. “Spotted Tail,” he said, “will you be
my friend?”</p>

<p class='c011'>A look of surprise and wonder came into the
sad eyes of the other, and for a moment he could
not understand just what Bumper was asking.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t understand,” he stammered in confusion.
“Oh, you mean will I promise never to
betray you again? Yes, yes, I promise that,
Bumper—promise never to speak ill of you
again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I didn’t mean that,” replied Bumper. “I
asked if you would be my friend. You know
what friendship means?—trust, faith, loyalty,
and all that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I trust you,” stammered Spotted Tail.
“How could it be otherwise after what you’ve
done for me? And faith, yes, I have faith in
you. I believe you’re a just and upright leader.
As for loyalty, Bumper, you can ask for my life,
and I’ll give it to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper smiled happily at these declarations
of friendship, but still Spotted Tail hadn’t quite
understood his meaning. How to make him believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>that he forgave everything, and wanted to
be his friend, troubled him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come with me, Spotted Tail,” he said finally,
extending a paw. “I want every one to see that
we have forgiven and forgotten, and that we’re
friends now.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then, to Spotted Tail’s surprise, Bumper led
him up to Fuzzy Wuzz, and said: “Spotted Tail
and I have made up all of our differences, and
are going to be fast friends hereafter. Congratulate
both of us, Fuzzy Wuzz.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Fuzzy Wuzz was as wise and quick as she was
good. She understood immediately, and, extending
a paw, grasped one of Spotted Tail’s. “Let
the past be as if it never were, Spotted Tail,” she
said sweetly. “Bumper’s friends are my friends,
and that makes us friends, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail nodded in embarrassment. He
was so stupefied with surprise that he hardly
knew what to say. Then to Goggle Eyes and
the others, Bumper took him in turn, and gave
them to understand that anything they said
against Spotted Tail they would be saying
against him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Old Blind Rabbit was the last one they
came to. Bumper repeated his words, but remained
a little uncertain just how the stern old
leader would accept the change. Old Blind Rabbit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>had a stern sense of justice, and this sudden
forgiveness of Spotted Tail might not suit him.
But finally a kindly smile spread over his face,
and he laid a paw on the breast of each.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have lived to see justice interpreted, O
Bumper,” he said. “There will be joy in all the
North Woods now that we have a king who is as
merciful as he is wise and just. May Spotted
Tail learn wisdom from you. The past is forgotten.
We live now only for the future.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And when they had retired to a corner from
the rest, Spotted Tail found his voice. It was
low and husky.</p>

<p class='c011'>“O Bumper, you have heaped coals of fire on
my head!” he exclaimed. “You have made me
ashamed of myself. I wronged you because I
was envious and jealous of your power. I told
Shrike to spread the news that you were a king
come to make all the rabbits in the North Woods
your slaves. Now they’re all your friends. But
you have one slave. I, Bumper, am your slave.
Ask anything of me, and I will do it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I ask one thing, Spotted Tail,” was the
reply, “and you’ve promised to grant it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I have promised, not knowing what it
is.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is very simple, Spotted Tail. Never let
me hear you call yourself my slave again. Instead,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>speak of me as your friend, and if you wish
to gain my favors call yourself my friend. Is
that too much to promise?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s not enough, O Bumper. But as you say.
I’m your friend—now and forevermore. You
believe me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, I know you speak the truth.”</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>STORY XIV<br /> <span class='large'>SPOTTED TAIL PROVES HIS LOYALTY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Old Blind Rabbit was so pleased with the
result of the revolt, and especially with Bumper’s
forgiveness of Spotted Tail, that he immediately
proclaimed a great feast to celebrate it. All the
younger rabbits were sent forth in the woods to
gather food for the banquet, and they came back
laden with the most delicious roots and succulent
leaves until their mouths watered. The burrow
was piled high with them, as if it was being
stocked against a ten-day siege by Mr. Fox and
Buster the Bear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now we will eat and be merry,” Old Blind
Rabbit said when they were all gathered around
the festive board. “May no more trouble come
to my family or to any of the other rabbits of
the woods!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper was called upon to make a speech,
which he did, and Spotted Tail led the others in
clapping his paws at the conclusion. While
the excitement was running high, Old Blind Rabbit
whispered in Bumper’s ear:</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“When you make a friend of your enemy, you
have made a friend indeed. Watch Spotted
Tail’s enthusiasm.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper had already been watching him, and
a little glow of pleasure was in his heart. Even
greater than being made king, he thought, was
the winning of Spotted Tail’s loyalty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All’s well that ends well,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, Rusty the Blackbird might have
doubted the genuineness of Spotted Tail’s friendship,
and so would have Shrike the Butcher Bird,
but that was because they didn’t understand the
nature and habits of the rabbits as Bumper and
Old Blind Rabbit did. They knew that Spotted
Tail had changed, and all the envy and hatred
had left his heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>As if to prove this, something happened in
the woods a few days later, which dispelled any
doubts that either may have had. Bumper and
Spotted Tail had gone off together in the thickest
part of the woods when they came to an old
gravel pit.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was a deep hole in the ground which had
nearly been covered up with thick weeds and
briers. Bumper and Spotted Tail had been hopping
along without thought of danger. Around
and over the gravel pit a thick clump of bushes
was growing.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>“I think I can take that clump with a big hop,”
Bumper remarked, preparing for a spring.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail glanced up to follow, and then
shouted in alarm: “Don’t do it, Bumper! The
gravel pit!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail had recognized the danger if
Bumper should fall short of his jump, but his
warning was too late. Bumper had sprung into
the air, and, just as Spotted Tail had feared,
the tops of the bushes interfered with his leap.
Instead of clearing the place, Bumper fell plump
through the mass of weeds into the deep pit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Down, down he went, scratching his face and
body as he fell. Instead of landing on all four
feet as he expected to do, he dropped heavily on
one foot and wrenched his leg.</p>

<p class='c011'>Spotted Tail heard his groans with alarm.
What had happened to Bumper?<a id='t101'></a> He called
aloud, and received only groans in reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now perhaps it would have been wiser for
Spotted Tail to have run back to the burrow, and
summon help; but he was so worried over the result
of the accident that only one thing occurred
to him. He deliberately leaped into the gravel
pit after Bumper. This required a good deal of
courage, for he knew the danger. He recalled
stories of how more than one rabbit in the past
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>had been caught in this natural trap and held
there for days and weeks until nearly famished.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he landed by the side of Bumper at the
bottom of the pit, he found the king huddled up
in a heap, groaning with pain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it, Bumper?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ve broken my leg or sprained it,” was the
reply. “And it pains so that even a king cannot
help moaning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let me see it,” replied Spotted Tail.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a long time Spotted Tail rubbed it, and
tried to ease the pain. After a while it grew
better, but it was still too lame for Bumper to
stand much weight on it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How am I ever going to get out of this
hole?” he asked, looking up. “I can’t jump out
of it with this sprained leg.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” replied Spotted Tail. “No rabbit has
ever yet been able to hop out of the gravel pit.
I’m afraid we’re trapped here until the others
find us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Is it so bad as that?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes, and worse.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then Spotted Tail told him the stories of the
gravel pit, and of the many times young rabbits
had been caught there.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It should have been filled in, then, before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>this,” said Bumper. “When I get home I’ll give
orders to have it filled up.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That would be a good idea. But the important
question now is, How are you going to
get out?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“How are you going to get out?” asked
Bumper, smiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That doesn’t matter so much if I can get
you out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You couldn’t jump to the top?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no rabbit could—not even you, Bumper.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if we stay here we’ll starve?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Unless Mr. Fox happens to discover us, and
eats us up. He’s big enough to scramble down
here and out again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s a pretty serious position we’re in, then,”
mused Bumper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have it!” Spotted Tail exclaimed suddenly.
“See that bush fallen in the hole. The
wind must have blown it in here. Now, I’ll
climb on it, and then you climb on my back. I
think by standing on my shoulders then you’ll
be able to reach the top and scramble out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But you? How’ll you get out?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I’ll manage it some way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This seemed like good advice, and Spotted
Tail made his way cautiously to the highest part
of the bush. Then Bumper followed him. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>he climbed up on Spotted Tail’s back, and stood
on his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now get ready when I raise myself up on
my hind legs!” cautioned Spotted Tail. “You
must jump and scramble up before the bush
gives way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>It was quite an acrobatic feat, but they balanced
themselves skilfully until both stood upright
on their haunches. “I can’t reach it!” exclaimed
Bumper. “It’s a foot above my head!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Jump, then!” exclaimed Spotted Tail.
“The bush is sagging down! Quick, Bumper,
jump!”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Bumper jumped, and scrambled up out
of the pit. It was hard work with his sprained
leg, but he reached the top. But Spotted Tail
had fallen back to the bottom, and the bush after
him. There was no way he could get out.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I’ll run back to the burrow and get help!”
Bumper said finally. “We’ll get you out somehow.”</p>

<p class='c011'>But the only way they could get Spotted Tail
out was to fill in the sand pit. Bumper hit on
this idea after they had tried every other method.
By filling it in Spotted Tail could gradually
crawl up higher and higher until he hopped out.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Bumper’s method of filling it in was very
simple. All the rabbits turned their faces away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>from the sand pit and began digging hard with
their hind legs, throwing the dirt and gravel in
the pit until it was nearly on a level with the
ground. So the dangerous sand pit was no longer
a trap for the rabbits.</p>

  <h2 class='c012'>STORY XV<br /> <span class='large'>BUMPER MAKES FUZZY WUZZ QUEEN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>A king can’t really be happy without a queen.
There was never a king yet that didn’t have one,
or, if he lived alone and refused to take a queen,
he was faithless to his people. If you want to
find a grouchy king, look through history for one
that never had a queen to advise and soothe him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper wasn’t thinking so much of doing a
great honor to Fuzzy Wuzz in asking her to be
his queen as he was of making himself happy.
Fuzzy Wuzz had become very dear to him. She
seemed to understand him, and they were both
happy when they were together.</p>

<p class='c011'>So one day, when he asked her to be his queen,
and help him to preside over his people, she modestly
consented. She thought as much of
Bumper as he did of her. They made an ideal
couple. But a king can’t marry without the consent
of his people, and Bumper took up the question
with Old Blind Rabbit first. He was very
modest and uncertain about it, and you can
imagine his nervousness.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“A king can marry, Old Blind Rabbit, and
bring a queen home with him to reign by his side,
can’t he?” he began.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Blind Rabbit showed a little surprise at
this question, and after a while answered: “A
queen, O Bumper, is generally selected by the
people. She must be one that they all like.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Isn’t the king consulted?” asked Bumper.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not always. Of course, sometimes he is, but
his choice must be the same as that of his people.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It seems to me, then,” remarked Bumper,
“that a king must have a hard time selecting a
queen.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has, O Bumper, and that is one reason
why a king isn’t always happy. He must think
of his people first, and of his own happiness
second.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper bowed meekly, and thought once more
that being a king was not as agreeable as he had
always thought.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And if his queen is not the one the people
choose,” he added, “what becomes of her and the
king?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“They’re often dethroned, O Bumper, driven
away into exile!” There was a threat in the Old
Blind Rabbit’s voice as he said this. His blind,
sightless eyes seemed to go through Bumper and
read his thoughts.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“You wish to select a queen?” continued
Blind Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper said yes, and blushed the color of his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Old Blind Rabbit looked distressed. “You
should not have thought of that,” he said severely,
“without first consulting your people. I have
already selected a queen for you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper’s heart dropped. This blunt announcement
took away all his happiness. Then
a slow sense of anger and rebellion came into his
mind. He wasn’t going to submit to any such
dictation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And I have selected one for myself!” he replied,
stubbornly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you must give her up, O Bumper! The
queen the people select must be the one to reign
with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper’s stubborn nature immediately came
to the surface. Rather than give up Fuzzy Wuzz
and take a queen that Old Blind Rabbit had
chosen for him, he would abdicate his throne, and
leave the woods. He said as much to Old Blind
Rabbit, who was greatly distressed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Think well of your words, O Bumper!” he
said. “If you disobey the rules of your people,
they will banish you, and drive you into exile.
A king cannot be above his people.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>“I told you that I would banish myself rather
than submit to this,” was the stubborn reply. “I
shall choose my own queen or have none. I must
live with her, and not you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This outburst of defiance became a king, and
in a good cause it would have received Old Blind
Rabbit’s approval; but just now it ran against
his wishes, and he saw nothing but rebellion in it.
It was little short of treason.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Even if you banish yourself,” Blind Rabbit
added angrily, “it does not follow you will take
your queen away with you. She would not follow
you into the woods. She might consent to
be your queen here, but not your wife in exile.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leave that to me,” replied Bumper, confidently.
“I know she will follow me wherever I
go.” Then, smiling at a new thought, he added:
“I can take her back to the garden where the
red-headed girl lives. She would welcome us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“We may prevent that, O Bumper! We may
decide to hold you prisoner. No, no, we can’t
permit such treason. It’s against the laws of
the woods.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now the argument was waxing strong, and
both were getting very angry. Perhaps they
would have parted as enemies if at that very
moment Fuzzy Wuzz hadn’t entered the burrow.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>Old Blind Rabbit turned to her, and took one of
her paws in his.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here is the queen the people have selected
for you, O Bumper,” he said. “And no other
will we have.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Bumper stared at the couple in
surprise. It seemed for a moment as if Old Blind
Rabbit was playing a joke on him. Then it
dawned suddenly upon his mind that they had
each chosen the same one to be queen. He began
to laugh so loudly and excitedly that Old Blind
Rabbit felt mortified. Was Bumper making fun
of Fuzzy Wuzz?</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is very unbecoming to you, O Bumper,”
he began, and then Bumper interrupted him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No, no, Blind Rabbit!” he protested. “It
isn’t that. Don’t you see I’m laughing because
I’m so happy? We have both been very foolish.
We got in hot words for nothing. Now forgive
me, and all will be well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t understand,” murmured Old Blind
Rabbit.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t blame you,” interrupted Bumper.
“But if you had eyes, and could see, you would
understand. Fuzzy Wuzz is as happy as I am,
and you could tell it by her eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Then solemnly, he added: “Old Blind Rabbit,
the queen my people have selected is the one I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>chose. Fuzzy Wuzz is the one I meant to have,
or none. Now do you understand?”</p>

<p class='c011'>It really took Old Blind Rabbit some minutes
to understand it fully, and then a gleam of happiness
swept across his face. “O Bumper,” he
exclaimed with emotion, “your reign will be a
happy one, and a joy to my people. Long may
the king live! And long may the queen live with
him!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He was so excited, and his voice was raised
so high, that all the other rabbits came running
in the burrow to see what the trouble was, and
when they learned the news they set up a joyful
squeal of approval. They would now have a
queen of their own selection as well as a king.</p>

<p class='c011'>This time Rusty the Black Bird, Piney the
Purple Finch, Mr. Crested Flycatcher, and all
the other birds of the woods agreed to carry the
message to the rabbits of the different burrows.
They flew with swift wings in all directions to
announce the wedding of Bumper and Fuzzy
Wuzz, inviting White Tail, Pink Nose, Crooked
Ears, Brindley the Lame and all the others to
the feast.</p>

<p class='c011'>For days and days the woods rang with happy
laughter and merry talk. Every one seemed to
be happy. Even Mr. Fox and Buster the Bear
were excited, for who could help it when so many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>others were looking forward to the crowning of
Fuzzy Wuzz as queen?</p>

<p class='c011'>And of their reign in the woods you will hear
later in other stories, for they lived happily as
king and queen for a good many years, and they
had adventures which you might guess were more
exciting than any you have yet heard. In the
land of rabbits they speak of time as having begun
in the reign of King Bumper and Queen
Fuzzy Wuzz, and they had good reason to date
their calendars from that year, as you will see
later when you have heard more about them in
the book entitled</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Washer was the youngest of a family of
three Raccoons, born in the woods close to
the shores of Beaver Pond, and not half a mile
from Rocky Falls where the water, as you
know, turns into silvery spray that sparkles
in the sunshine like diamonds and rubies.
And, indeed, the animals and birds of the
North Woods much prefer this glittering
spray and foam that rise in a steady cloud
from the bottom of the falls to all the jewels
and gems ever dug out of the earth! For,
though each drop sparkles but a moment, and
then vanishes from sight, there are a million
others to follow it, and when you bathe in
them they wash and scour away the dirt, and
make you clean and fresh in body and soul.</p>

<p class='c011'>Washer had his first great adventure at
Rocky Falls, and it is a wonder that he ever
lived to tell the tale, for the water which
flows over the falls is almost as cruel and terrible
as it is sparkling and inviting. But</p>

<p class='c011'>In the North Woods where Buster was
born, a wide river tinkles merrily over stones
that are so white you’d mistake them for snowballs,
if you were not careful, and begin pelting
each other with them. The birches hanging
over the water look like white sticks of
peppermint candy, except in the spring of the

and then they make you think of fairyland
where everything is painted the colors of the

<p class='c011'>The rocks that slope up from the bank of
the river are dented and broken as if some
giant in the past had smashed them with his
hammer, cracking some and punching deep
holes in others. It was in one of these holes,
or caves, that Buster was born.</p>

his many travels in different parts of the

event to him. He had been away so
long—ever since he was a little cub—that
nothing seemed familiar to him. His recollection
of the river that flowed in front of
the cave where he had been born was very
dim and uncertain, and he was not sure which
way to go when he had crossed it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Browny the Woodchuck had informed him
that he was in the North Woods when he

<p class='c011'>High among the timberland of the North
Woods White Tail the Deer was born, and if
you had stumbled upon his home in the thickets
you would have been surprised by a noise
like the rushing of the wind, and then by a
very remarkable silence that could almost be
felt. The first was made by Mother White
Tail as she deserted her young and took to
quick flight.</p>

<p class='c011'>White Tail, crouching low down in the
bushes, so still that he scarcely moved a hair,
would hide his beautiful head in the branches
and leaves like an obedient child. Left alone
he knew that his one chance of escape was not
to move or whimper or cry.</p>

<p class='c011'>That was the first lesson White Tail was
taught by his mother—to keep absolutely
quiet in the presence of danger. When he
was so small that he could hardly hold up his
head, she whispered to him: “Listen, White
Tail! When I give the signal that the hunters
are coming, you must flatten yourself down</p>

<p class='c011'>White Tail grew rapidly in size and
strength, his long, clean limbs showing taut
muscles and great springing power; and his
neck grew thick and short, which is well for a
buck, who must use it in savage thrusts when
the head is a battering ram. His horns were
short and bony, but they protruded in front
like knobs against which it would be unpleasant
to fall.</p>

<p class='c011'>But his antlers were his pride. They spread
out fan-shape on his head, crowning it with
a glory that made Mother Deer supremely
happy. At times it seemed as if the antlers
were too heavy for the head and neck, but
White Tail carried them easily, and when he
shook them in sport or anger any one could
see they were just fitted to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>In time he stood as high as Father Buck,
and a head taller than Mother Deer. The
day the tip of his antlers reached an inch above
Father Buck’s, he felt a little thrill of pride.</p>

North Woods, but only one real Bobby
Gray Squirrel, and if you saw him once you
would never mistake him for any other. Bobby
was a gay, rollicking happy-go-lucky fellow,
who believed in enjoying himself to-day and
letting the morrow take care of itself. He
wasn’t exactly lazy, but he didn’t believe in
doing work that wasn’t actually necessary,
and sometimes, I’m afraid, he forgot to do
what was really necessary.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bobby had many friends in the woods, and
they all liked him and smiled at him, but
there were some who thought his careless
ways might get him in trouble some day. So
instead of chattering pleasantly with him, they
shook their heads and preached to him.</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>When Bobby Gray Squirrel left the deserted
house where he had spent the winter
with Stripe the Chipmunk and Web the Flying
Squirrel, not to mention White Foot the
Deer Mouse, he was in a very serious mood,
and his first thought was to go right to work
to build a home for himself in some friendly
tree, and stock it early with nuts for winter
use.</p>

<p class='c011'>His experience that winter, before he had
found his fortune in the bag of nuts in the
tower room, had made him very thoughtful.
“I’m not going to put off work again that
should be done to-day,” he said to himself as
he frisked along from tree to tree. “I can’t
expect to have such good luck another winter.
But my!”—smiling in recollection—“those
nuts were delicious!”</p>

<p class='c011'>He smacked his lips at the thought, and
right on top of it came the low trill of a bird.
It was Goldy the Oriole, who had just returned
north.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now in the reign of King Bumper and
Queen Fuzzy Wuzz many things happened
in the woods that made exciting times for the
wild rabbits and their friends. They came to
pass in the first year of their reign, for Bumper
the white rabbit was not content to be idle
when his people were surrounded by so many
enemies that their lives were never safe.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some kings just eat and drink and make
merry the live long day, and forget all about
duty; but lots of such kings have lost their
thrones, and others who have ruled wisely
have been blessed with many friends, and
when they died all the people mourned their
loss.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bumper the white rabbit intended to be a
good and wise ruler, and therefore he spent
much time in trying to think of ways to help
his wild cousins of the woods. The story of
how he escaped from the garden owned by the</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Bumper, after working hard to trick his
enemies so they would be more afraid of the
rabbits in the woods, had decided the ways of
peace were better than those of war. Not that
he was going to permit Sneaky the Wolf or
Loup the Lynx to pounce upon his people and
eat them up without fighting, but instead of
going around with a chip on his shoulder, expecting
and looking for trouble, he intended
to make friends of all the animals and birds,
and be helpful to them.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is wonderful how much good to others we
can overlook if we go about with our eyes
shut. There is plenty to do if we look for it.
So Bumper found in a short time that he had
missed a good deal in always looking for the
worst in others instead of for the best.</p>

<p class='c011'>Only a few days after his change of plans,
which was told of in a former book, Bumper
stumbled upon Sleepy the Opossum in a tree,
with his eyes closed in slumber. At first he</p>

</div>

<p class='c011'>There was once an old woman who had so
many rabbits that she hardly knew what to do.
They ate her out of house and home, and kept
the cupboard so bare she often had to go to bed
hungry. But none of the rabbits suffered this
way. They all had their supper, and their breakfast,
too, even if there wasn’t a crust left in the
old woman’s cupboard.</p>

<p class='c011'>There were big rabbits and little rabbits; lean
ones and fat ones; comical little youngsters who
played pranks upon their elders, and staid, serious
old ones who never laughed or smiled the
livelong day; boy rabbits and girl rabbits,
mother rabbits and father rabbits, and goodness
knows how many aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces,
cousins, second cousins and distant relatives-in-law!
They all lived under one big roof in the</p>
